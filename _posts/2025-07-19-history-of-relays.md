## The Birth of the Relay

To explore the history of the relay, we must first understand the origin of the electric telegraph. This invention marks the beginning of telecommunications, which eventually became a limitless source of digital devices and information technology. However, it emerged only after a century of attempts to transmit "information" (what we now call data) using electricity.

But first, it's important to clarify that the people we are discussing had a very different understanding of electricity compared to our modern concepts. Our physics textbooks have condensed the diverse history into a neat set of concepts and equations, often omitting centuries of development and conflicts between various philosophical schools. For example, Ohm never wrote the formula V = IR, and Maxwell didn't create Maxwell's equations.

I won't attempt to delve into the intricate history of the intellectual development of electricity but will try to present ideas as they existed at the time, rather than retroactively fitting them into our current understanding.

#### **Electric Fluid**

The phenomenon of electrical attraction has been known since ancient times. In the 6th century BC, Thales of Miletus recorded his observations of how rubbing a piece of amber (in Greek, "electron"—named after the star Electra from the Pleiades constellation in Taurus) against cat fur caused feathers and other light objects to suddenly be attracted to the amber. However, for many centuries, this curiosity didn't attract much attention.

With the rise of experimental natural philosophy in the 17th and 18th centuries, scientists began to take a greater interest in the oddities of nature. According to the Aristotelian view of the world, which dominated European philosophy throughout the Renaissance, only clearly observable patterns could lead to an understanding of natural truths. The new experimenters refuted this perspective. Francis Bacon wrote the opposite in his work "The Great Instauration" in 1620:

> I want the natural philosophy I propose to be a history not only of free and unrestrained nature (when left to itself and working independently) but more a history of nature subjected to constraints and disturbances. When by human design and action, it is forced out of its natural state, compressed, and transformed. The nature of things reveals itself more readily under the hands of man than when it is in a free state.

English physicist William Gilbert was the first to coin a term that acknowledged that the "influence" on amber was part of a more general phenomenon. In his 1600 treatise "On the Magnet, Magnetic Bodies, and the Great Magnet Earth," he called this phenomenon "electricus," meaning "to behave like amber." He described numerous substances that exhibited the ability to attract other things after being rubbed, including gemstones, glass, and sulfur. Still following the ancient model of matter consisting of four elements—fire, air, water, and earth—Gilbert believed that it was the watery part of these substances that gave them electrical energy. However, he couldn't envision this energy being used to transmit messages. The force of attraction worked only over very short distances.

**Gilbert demonstrates an electrical experiment at the court of Queen Elizabeth (a fragment of a 19th-century painting)**

By the early 18th century, other methods of generating electricity had been invented. It was discovered that placing a hand on a rotating sphere could create a powerful electrical force and even transmit it along a string. A few years later, Stephen Gray discovered that he could transmit this force over several hundred yards. Other similar electrical machines were also created.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2F5UucNNzIhhRBJoPZ3SJ5%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=322417da-f137-4949-8e56-b45c990b4a58" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Otto von Guericke's "sulfur sphere" generator, circa 1660**

By this time, scientists began to conceive of electricity as a fluid that accumulates and then flows from one place to another. Unlike Gilbert, they didn't believe this fluid was ordinary water but imagined it as some intangible substance. Some thought that several different fluids were responsible for light, magnetism, electricity, and even life. Others believed there was a single etheric fluid that manifested itself in different ways.

The best container for this fluid was discovered in 1746 with the invention of the so-called "Leyden jar," named after the city where it first gained fame. The device, in its finished form, consisted of a glass jar wrapped inside and out with metal foil and with a metal rod sticking out of the top, connected to the internal foil.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FVcsxxuMzl8niLhyFmtmd%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a2ecdf1c-7078-485e-95c0-ab94bd848723" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If connected to an electrical machine, the jar could store large amounts of electrical fluid, as if it had been poured into the jar. This fluid would discharge with a strong spark when the rod was connected to the external foil.

By then, a scientific subculture of "electricians" had emerged. With an electrical generator and a Leyden jar, one could easily experiment with electricity without delving into the mathematical intricacies of the subject. Moreover, one could perform colorful and impressive demonstrations. Benjamin Franklin, the most famous of these electricians, even suggested that several such devices linked together be used to kill and then cook a turkey for dinner. He called this configuration of multiple jars a "battery" (by analogy with a battery of cannons):

> The turkey should be killed for dinner with an electrical shock, then roasted with an electrical discharge before a fire ignited by an electric bottle. And the health of all the famous electricians in England, Holland, France, and Germany should be drunk from charged glasses under a salvo of electric battery cannons.

Having tapped into the capabilities of the Leyden jar, scientists realized that the electrical fluid could be transmitted over long distances, seemingly instantaneously. Experimenters proved this in practice by sending charges through various media, including rivers and lakes. The demonstrations by the French abbot Jean-Antoine Nollet became particularly famous. He sent a discharge through 180 soldiers of the royal guard and then through a chain of Carthusian monks spanning one and a half kilometers. Each monk was connected to the others by holding metal wires. By this time, experiments had already shown that metal wires were the best medium for transmission—that they were "conductors" for electricity.

**Projectors**

Using new tools—friction-based electrostatic generators, Leyden jars, and conductive wires—scientists began to make the first attempts to transmit messages using electricity. In 1753, someone with the initials C.M., whose identity remains unknown, sent his plan, "A Method of Rapid Information Transmission," to the _Scot's Magazine_. He described a system using a wire for each letter of the alphabet. At the end of each wire was a sponge-like ball. When a charge was transmitted through the wire, the electrified ball was supposed to lift the corresponding piece of paper with the letter on it. It is unknown who this C.M. was or whether such a device was ever built.

But over the following hundred years, others followed in his footsteps. In 1774, Swiss physicist Georges-Louis Le Sage proposed a system with 26 wires, similar to the one described by the mysterious C.M. The 26 letters were arranged in it like a clavichord. He considered presenting this system to Frederick the Great "so that he could assess its usefulness," but even if he managed to do so, the monarch was unimpressed, as nothing more is known about it.

**How Le Sage's telegraph might have looked (from a 19th-century engraving). Note the electrical machine on the right.**

Twenty years later, a Spaniard named Don Francisco Salva proposed a system for transmitting messages directly to the human body. The receiver was to hold the wire and receive messages directly when the other end of the wire received a discharge from a Leyden jar. He didn't explain how he would find volunteers willing to hold the wire all day, waiting for an electric shock. Later, he built a more humane system that created sparks between pieces of tin foil, which he demonstrated to the Spanish court.

There are many other examples of such use of electricity in the 19th century.

Such telegraph experimenters appeared on the periphery of electrical science. Franklin, Volta, Faraday, and other scientists exploring the deeper nature of electricity weren't interested in methods of transmitting information. This was the era of "projectors," people with grand plans ranging from establishing a Scottish colony on the Isthmus of Panama to realizing the ancient dream of alchemical transmutation. They were mocked by Jonathan Swift, who filled the "Academy of Lagado" in _Gulliver's Travels_ with people futilely trying to extract sunlight from cucumbers and engaged in other nonsense. Projectors like Le Sage and Salva faced several obstacles in creating a practical and efficient system, which needed:

1. A reliable source. Electrical machines and Leyden jars were too finicky and potentially dangerous, incapable of providing a smooth flow of electrical fluid (what we would call a steady current). Moreover, in modern terms, they produced too much voltage, leading to significant losses in poorly insulated wires.
2. Effective methods of detecting the signal and translating it into language. The problem consisted of two parts: building a sensitive enough detector and a method to encode the language in this detector. Most electrician-projectors tried to directly represent letters of the alphabet at the other end of the wire, either using a wire for each letter or devices like synchronized wheels or multiple needles pointing to the correct letter.
3. A conceptual framework to guide experiments in the right direction. Ohm didn't develop his famous law until 1827, and outside of Germany, it became known only in the 1840s. Until then, it was very difficult to understand why certain combinations of wires, electrical sources, and detectors worked beautifully while others failed completely.

In the following sections, we'll learn how these obstacles were overcome in the subsequent decades, mostly as side effects of solving completely different problems. But first, we need to examine the device with which all attempts to transmit information using electricity will be compared—the telegraph. For before the familiar telegraph we all know

, there was another, completely different kind of telegraph.

**Continuing Our Story of the Digital Switch’s Emergence: A Detailed Exploration of the First Telegraph**

Indeed, the electric telegraph should be compared to this device, as it is fundamentally linked to its history. And besides, it’s just an interesting topic.

**The Chappe Brothers**

In 1789, Claude Chappe was living a carefree life. He was a clergyman, receiving income from a church benefice located in rural France. However, instead of spending his days saving peasant souls, he moved to Paris, joined a group of philosophers, and began writing papers on experimental physics.

With the arrival of the Revolution, his life became more complicated. The new government abolished benefices, and Chappe needed a new source of income. His brothers Ignace, Claude, and Abraham were also unemployed. The brothers returned to their hometown in Brittany and devised a new scheme to earn money. They decided to create a long-distance message transmission system and sell it to the new revolutionary government.

The first attempt, made during the winter of 1790-1791, was based on a system of synchronized clocks. They placed two pendulum clocks with special symbols on their dials behind their parents' house. The sender of a message would strike a gong, and in response, both the sender and the receiver would start their clocks. The sender would then give another signal when the clock's hand reached the desired symbol. The receiver would check their dial and record the symbol received. Using a special reference guide, words could be formed from these symbols.

The Chappe brothers knew that sound was not a practical method for synchronization over long distances. Claude experimented with various methods for sending the signals "start the clocks" and "record the symbol," including electricity, but without success. Eventually, he settled on a board with one dark and one light side. Turning the board to the light side replaced the gong strike. Using a telescope, the receiver could distinguish the dark and light side from many kilometers away.

By the summer of 1792, Claude realized that he could eliminate the need for dial clocks altogether by adding more boards. Their positions could directly encode the required symbol. By this time, he and his brothers had gained enough confidence and began seeking support in the National Assembly, of which Ignace was a member. They named their device the "telegraph," or "distant writer."

The panels were eventually replaced by a signal semaphore consisting of three movable metal arms on a pole. Each position encoded its own symbol. A clever system of pulleys allowed the operator to control the semaphore using levers, which had to be positioned exactly as the semaphore needed to be.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FaEhPYcIZ1H1XVRYSNjBB%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=f1244cba-5480-4e9a-87aa-4cdde94d9b0b" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

With the support of like-minded individuals from the new National Convention, the Chappe brothers received funding to establish a trial line in northern France in April 1793. Satisfied with the performance of the device, the government commissioned the construction of a full-sized line from Paris to Lille, located 225 miles from the northwestern border. By the summer of 1794, it gained widespread recognition as it successfully transmitted information about the French victory in the Austrian Netherlands (now Belgium) just a few hours after the event itself. Except for signal fires and other older technologies with similarly low bandwidth, no message had previously traveled such a distance faster than a mounted courier.

**The Era of the Telegraph**

In 1796, Abraham Niklas Edelcrantz wrote in his treatise on the telegraph:

> With new inventions, it often happens that part of the public finds them useless, while another part considers them impossible. When it becomes clear that the possibility and usefulness can no longer be denied, the majority agrees that the device was rather easy to invent and that they have known about it for a long time.

Indeed, after the invention's success was proven, society in France considered the Chappe system a great benefit to the Republic. Consequently, imitators emerged across Europe, making necessary adjustments to the design to satisfy national pride. The first and foremost among them was Edelcrantz himself, a Swedish librarian, teacher, and poet, who, upon learning about the Chappe telegraph in September 1794, immediately began experimenting with his own versions of the project. Over the following decade, Britain, Prussia, Spain, the Netherlands, and others constructed telegraph systems of various kinds.

**Telegraph Station on the Top of the Medieval Church on Montmartre (Then Outside Paris)**

Napoleon had a particular fondness for the telegraph, using it as a tool for political control and military might. Immediately following the coup d'état of 1799, which made him First Consul, he signaled his new authority with a telegraph message: "Paris est tranquille et les bons citoyens sont contents" \[“Paris is quiet and the good citizens are happy”]. As Emperor, he oversaw the further expansion of the system, extending it from the Po Valley in northern Italy (the scene of his early victories) all the way to Venice.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FUXSM3nmZM33jVjrm9NYR%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=646d845a-bdfc-4c3b-9413-7de91b5222fe" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

European rulers like Napoleon saw the telegraph primarily as a tool of state power, especially during wartime. Many European systems were built as early warning systems against invasions during the long series of wars triggered by the French Revolution, which lasted until Napoleon’s final defeat in 1815. Ignatius Chappe lamented in his "History of the Telegraph" that the higher authorities did not consider adapting the telegraph for commercial use. He believed that the invention, given a chance, could have created new trans-European markets and transformed Paris into a financial capital.

Instead, the French shut down much of the network during the year-long Peace of Amiens in 1802-1803, the British allowed their system to fall into disrepair at the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, and the Swedish telegraph system declined after the end of hostilities with Russia in 1809.

Entrepreneurs set up private commercial lines in Germany, Britain, and France, usually for early warning of approaching ships. For example, Johann Schmidt managed a line from Cuxhaven on the North Sea to the Hamburg port on the Elbe from 1837 to 1848. But these were exceptions. In the U.S., all telegraphs were small private enterprises, mainly built in Boston, Philadelphia, and New York.

So why did it take so long for the telegraph to emerge? Its physical components—metallic and wooden parts, pulleys, and ropes—had been known for a long time. The only new component that increased its practicality was the telescope, which allowed for stations to be placed 5 miles apart. But even this tool was nearly 200 years old by the time the Chappes began their experiments. Several methods for transmitting messages over long distances using telescopes and visual signals had been proposed—one of the most famous by Robert Hooke. Yet, none of these worked.

Thus, the explanation for the phenomenon must lie not in a lack of technical resources. Surely, persistence, energy, and political savvy of the Chappe brothers played a role. I also believe that the unique situation created by the French Revolution contributed. Others, although they imitated the Chappe telegraph, never built networks on the same scale and size.

All French governments of the 1790s felt (not without reason) that they were in a state of constant siege and emergency. A new tool that could alert them to the activity of their numerous enemies was bound to be appreciated. This was enough for the National Convention to push through the Chappe idea, allowing them to charge a high price for their device and clear trees and other obstacles during the construction of their line.

Part of the Revolution’s ideology was to unite the entire French nation and eliminate the remnants of the parochial habits of the feudal era. Therefore, projects like the metric system, designed to replace many local systems of weights and measures with one supposedly more rational system, were supported. The telegraph, with its towers stretching from one corner of France to another, fit well into this ideology. Bertrand Barère, a prominent delegate to the National Convention, placed the telegraph alongside printing, gunpowder, and the compass in a gallery of inventions that "removed the greatest obstacles to human civilization and made possible the unification of people into great republics."

**Optical Inspires Electric**

The existence of the telegraph influenced all attempts to transmit messages using electricity. Now, electric inventors had a clear example to follow. They built a new type of telegraph—variously called electric, electromagnetic, voltaic, galvanic, etc.—depending on the place, time, and temperament.

It's worth noting two historical examples where the paths of optical and electric telegraphs intersected.

**Optical Inspires Electric**

On April 10, 1809, the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded the Kingdom of Bavaria, an ally of France. Napoleon was quickly informed via the nearest telegraph station in Strasbourg. He arrived at the front from Paris on the 16th, drove the Austrians out of Bavaria, and defeated their forces near Vienna three months later in the Battle of Wagram. This was Napoleon’s last great success.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FHJPXdEX4aPbV77v2Ndya%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d7135843-2437-462f-9a2d-e351bedf4187" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Bavarian government ministers were astounded by the speed with which Napoleon arrived. In less than a week, a message and a person had completed a round trip of over 1600 kilometers, or about 150 miles per day. They sought the advice of Samuel Sommering, a distinguished member of the Academy of Sciences, and requested a technical proposal for constructing their own telegraph.

To their surprise, Sommering returned later that same summer with a proposal describing not Chappe’s telegraph, but an electric variant. His design was based on the principle of electrolysis—the separation of water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity. It consisted of 35 wires, each ending in a separate vessel of water. The ends of the wires were marked with letters of the alphabet and digits from 0 to 9. Applying electricity to the wires caused bubbles to rise in front of the corresponding letter or digit.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FimcKWsMs79LcyZPy9HEV%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=255eb16c-5428-4c4a-af2b-8af743fbd2ce" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Sommering sent a copy of his device to Paris, hoping that Napoleon might be interested, but the Emperor never saw it. Sommering’s device would have become just another historical curiosity, like many other electric telegraphs invented around 1800. However, it unexpectedly set off a chain of events that led to the development of the first commercial telegraph nearly thirty years later and 800 kilometers from where Sommering was. Napoleon was yet to play a role in this chain of events, and we will return to this story in due course.

**Optical Versus Electrical?**

Another story involves Francis Ronalds, a British electricity experimenter, inventor, and notable engineer. In the summer of 1816, he aimed to prove the practicality of the electric telegraph. His system, in its simplest form, replicated Chappe’s early experiments—it used synchronized clocks with dials at each end of the line. The difference was that the synchronizing signal was electrical.

When he connected his machine to the wire, a pair of balls made of porous wood at the far end of the wire would become charged and start repelling each other. This was the signal for the recipient to either start their clocks or read the symbol from the dial and record the letter. On his lawn, he stretched 13 kilometers of iron wire across two large wooden frames to demonstrate how the system worked over practical distances.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FS0sAoJONSw1SspUQUSXO%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=0cb7902d-97c5-4d0d-bdc1-02e2c141d8aa" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Ronalds wrote to the British Admiralty about his new method of "telegraphic communication" and requested an audience to demonstrate his "device." The Admiralty secretary, John Barrow, bluntly replied that "telegraphs of any kind are now completely useless, and no other telegraph, other than those already in use, will be adopted."**

This story is often told with a hint of schadenfreude, highlighting Barrow's shortsightedness. However, there are several nuances:

1. **Ronalds' System**: Ronalds' system was not comparable to the successful electric telegraphs of the 1840s. There is no reason to believe that if Barrow had responded enthusiastically to Ronalds' letter, the electric telegraph would have successfully emerged decades earlier.
2. **Military Tool**: European states regarded the telegraph as a military tool. After Napoleon's fall, the need for such a system diminished significantly (or nearly disappeared).
3. **Prevalence of Proposals**: The Admiralty was already accustomed to a constant stream of telegraph improvement proposals, many of which came from charlatans and eccentrics. Ronalds himself acknowledged that "everyone knew the telegraph had long since bored everyone at the Admiralty."

Nevertheless, the potential advantages of the electric telegraph were clear. Optical telegraphs faced numerous natural enemies: rain, smoke, fog, snow, and short winter days could delay message transmission by days in adverse conditions. For instance, the British Admiralty station in London was non-operational for 100 days a year due to "London fog" (i.e., coal smoke). An electric telegraph with well-insulated wires would not be affected by the weather. Its messages would arrive instantly. Moreover, it would be cheaper to maintain, as personnel would be needed only at the sending and receiving stations, rather than at intervals every few miles in rural areas.

However, the practical implementation of transmitting information via electricity remained uncertain.

## Galvanism

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FBg8xBTfFeBajPXz62Br7%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a91f394c-746c-4700-8ad8-aae0ea689fda" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In our previous discussion, we skipped over several decades of the history of the electric telegraph. While the demonstrations of its functionality were captivating and it appeared to be a promising novelty, it still needed to prove its practical utility. By the 1830s, however, electrical engineers had made several critical discoveries that made the modern version of the electric telegraph possible. It all began with a frog.

#### Animal Electricity

In November 1780, Luigi Galvani, a physician and anatomist at the University of Bologna, was dissecting a frog with a scalpel that had an ivory handle. Nearby, his assistant was using an electrical machine (what we would now call an electrostatic generator). Suddenly, the frog's leg twitched. Galvani was astonished—had he accidentally touched a nerve? He conducted several experiments and discovered that the convulsions only occurred when the electrical machine was sparking while his finger touched the metal blade of the scalpel, which was also in contact with the frog.

By that time, natural philosophers were already aware that animals could generate electricity. Electric rays, known for their ability to render fish and humans insensible, had been recognized since ancient times and described by Aristotle. However, the source of their power remained unknown for centuries. By the 18th century, some electricians began to suspect that the effects were electrical when they observed similar paralysis effects produced by a Leyden jar. Experiments conducted in the 1770s convincingly demonstrated that rays could deliver electric shocks to living beings.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FFNYOnDYHPC6b7QpGiU7D%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e341b6f8-fbf4-4098-9289-4307014ec1b3" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

However, Galvani’s experiments led to more profound conclusions: all animal life was, in some sense, based on electricity. He proposed that “electricity was the greatest vital force, through which definitions of understanding and the command of will were transmitted from the brain to the obedient members of the body.” This connection established by Galvani’s discoveries captivated all of Europe, and the most famous result of this fascination was Mary Shelley's novel _Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus_.

For our purposes, what Galvani discovered six years later is most relevant. Galvani’s nephew was suspending frogs on metal hooks hanging from a balcony outside his uncle’s laboratory and noticed something peculiar. When the hooks touched the railings, the frogs began to convulse continuously, similar to the effects of electrical sparks. Initially, Galvani dismissed this anomaly, but he later found that touching the frogs with different metals, such as iron, copper, or brass, simultaneously produced even more pronounced effects. This persistent electrical flow, whose cause remained unclear at the time, was named galvanism.

#### Galvani's Experimental Apparatus In the above image.

Galvani believed he had discovered “animal electricity”—that metal connecting two separate reservoirs of electrical fluid in muscles and nerves allowed it to flow, leading to nerve activity. His contemporary, Alessandro Volta, had a different perspective. A professor of physics at the University of Pavia near Milan, Volta thought that the source of electrical flow was the metal, not the animal, and set out to prove this.

At that time, the only tools capable of detecting this “weak electricity” from metal contact were frogs and the human tongue. To substantiate his theory, Volta needed a non-biological detector. He turned to the recently invented “duplicator” by William Nicholson, an English natural philosopher. By rotating isolated brass discs placed side by side, the duplicator could amplify a small initial charge into a larger one. Using the duplicator, Volta was able to amplify the weak electricity from metal contact to a level detectable with a conventional electrometer, disproving Galvani’s hypothesis. More interestingly, Volta discovered that after sufficient rotations, the duplicator itself began generating detectable amounts of electricity even without an initial charge.

Soon, Volta was experimenting with stacks of paired discs made from different metals. He was inspired by another of Nicholson’s works, which described the dissection of the electric organ of a ray. Nicholson had found that this organ consisted of a mass of columns, each made up of a stack of small circular layers. Nicholson believed a machine could be constructed to simulate the functioning of this organ, possibly using mica sheets. Volta agreed with the principle but disagreed with the materials. By 1799, he settled on stacks of zinc discs paired with copper ones, with pieces of leather or cardboard soaked in seawater placed between the discs of each pair. This device could generate a significant and steady electric current. Another variation of the design, which he called the “crown of cups,” consisted of cups containing acid or saline solution connected by plates made of two different metals fused together.

#### The Discovery of the Battery and Electromagnetism

After Volta announced his discovery to the Royal Society in London in March 1800, it spread across Europe with remarkable speed. By May, Volta's device had led to a significant breakthrough: the decomposition of water using electricity, achieved by none other than Nicholson working with surgeon Anthony Carlisle. The device came to be known as the “voltaic pile,” a term already in use for describing a combination of Leyden jars.

At this point, Galvani had already passed away. In 1797, Napoleon had reorganized northeastern Italy into the Cisalpine Republic, a client state of the First French Republic. Volta adapted to the new order, receiving the Legion of Honor, becoming a count, and a senator. Galvani, having refused to swear allegiance to the republican government, was dismissed from his university position and died in poverty a year later. Yet, the study of galvanism thrived and expanded—thanks to Volta’s battery.

#### Electromagnetism

The battery allowed for the first detailed study of electricity in motion. Leyden jars and other static devices provided only instantaneous discharges. Now, researchers could set up the battery, connect it to any experimental apparatus, and methodically investigate the effects of dynamic electricity.

Soon, researchers applied the new device to explore the relationship between electricity and magnetism. Since ancient times, there had been suspicions of a deep connection between these “occult” attractive forces, yet their mysterious differences persisted. For example, electrified amber attracted any lightweight object, while magnetite attracted only iron.

In the 17th century, new evidence emerged when philosophers noted reports of lightning magnetizing iron objects (such as church steeples) and deflecting ship’s compasses. Benjamin Franklin demonstrated that Leyden jars could magnetize or reverse the polarity of a magnet—and this was unsurprising, given that by then he and other researchers had shown that lightning was electrical by nature. However, the evidence was not conclusive. What was the true connection between electricity and magnetism? By the end of the 18th century, opinions were divided. Some believed the observed similarities were coincidental, while others were convinced that a single underlying cause explained both phenomena.

Following Galvani and Volta’s discoveries, philosophers began investigating possible interactions between galvanism and magnetism. The most important results emerged in 1820 when Hans Christian Ørsted, a professor of physics at the University of Copenhagen, noticed during a lecture that a galvanic current deflected a magnetized needle. Subsequent experiments led Ørsted to publish his findings: a current flowing from north to south over a needle would push its end west; flowing underneath it would push it east.

When André-Marie Ampère read about Ørsted’s discovery in Paris, he immediately began to delve into the matter. Ampère was a professor of mathematics at the École Polytechnique in Paris. This premier engineering school, like the optical telegraph, was a product of the French Revolution and was intended to produce military engineers proficient in advanced mathematics and physics. Ørsted observed the effect, while Ampère sought its underlying cause, applying significant mathematical and experimental skills. He managed to eliminate the influence of the Earth's magnetic field on the experiment by aligning two magnetized needles in opposite directions. He discovered that such a double needle formed a perfect right angle with the wire. Intrigued, he proposed that magnetism was caused by tiny closed electric currents flowing perpendicular to the magnet’s axis, oriented north to south.

Over the next decade, this model proved highly effective—other scientists began experimenting with coiled wire to simulate these circular currents. François Arago, a colleague of Ampère, was the first to demonstrate that a coil could magnetize a needle.

A few years later, William Sturgeon improved on Arago’s results. He sought to produce vivid demonstrations of electromagnetic forces using a small battery, making it easier to showcase electromagnetic phenomena to students and interested audiences. At that time, even small magnetic effects visible only to nearby observers required substantial galvanic energy, necessitating large, expensive, and maintenance-intensive batteries.

Sturgeon found that wrapping a wire around a varnished iron core and connecting it to a small battery created a powerful electromagnet that retained its magnetic properties while the current flowed through the wire. The magnet became even stronger if the core was bent into a horseshoe shape—allowing it to lift a load of up to 4 kilograms.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FgYjBmM13FIokojZ9NX5Y%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=481db4fb-3109-4707-b5f0-d31e839a4170" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Joseph Henry, a teacher at the Albany Academy in New York, kept up with the work of European physicists on electricity and magnetism through journals such as the "Annals of Philosophy," where Sturgeon had published his description of the electromagnet.

Henry also attempted to build improved experimental equipment for educational demonstrations. He believed he could surpass Sturgeon by perfecting Ampère's model of closed currents. Henry created a hybrid of Sturgeon’s electromagnet and Julian Schweiger’s “multiplier,” which used tightly wound wire in silk insulation to significantly enhance the effect observed in Ørsted’s experiments.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FfxJ9uuO27TZ6iTYSoG5y%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=eaf45db2-6393-4607-b4d8-50c006ce36fc" alt=""><figcaption><p>Schweiger’s Multiplier, Later Called the Galvanometer</p></figcaption></figure>

The use of silk-insulated wire allowed Henry to wind the wire tightly around an iron core without risking short circuits, bringing him closer to Ampère’s model of closed currents than the poorly wound coils of Sturgeon’s electromagnet. With this improvement, he found he could lift hundreds, and later thousands, of kilograms using a regular battery.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2Fd5NZESTNN4loi5mMHRND%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=b809270e-b744-4e8c-bdb7-6a64734cf388" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The ability of electricity to generate magnetism and attract metal—a concept long suspected and later confirmed by Ørsted and refined by his successors—would prove to be crucial for subsequent creators of the electric telegraph.

**Theory of Circuits**

During this period, it was not difficult to imagine a new type of telegraph that used a galvanic battery as its power source and electromagnetic effects as its detector. Ampère had pointed this out as early as 1820.

By 1824, Peter Barlow, a renowned professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy near London, sought to investigate whether the telegraph described by Ampère could operate over long distances. To his dismay, he found that the strength of the electromagnetic effect diminished sharply even at a modest distance of 60 meters, leading him to conclude that an electromagnetic telegraph had no practical application. Barlow's reputation was sufficient to halt telegraph experiments in England for over a decade.

Why did some experiments with electric telegraphs fail as dramatically as Barlow's, while others (such as those by Francis Ronalds) successfully operated with kilometers of wire? Scientists needed an intellectual framework, a model to understand electricity in motion, to determine which devices would work and which would not.

Enter Joseph Henry once more. While experimenting with electromagnets in the late 1820s, he discovered that at a certain point, the loss of current strength due to wire length surpassed any attempts to increase the number of coils around the core. This finding in itself confirmed Barlow's conclusions.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FFD4GYT9rNgVcaX4dfCsX%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=b9aab0ab-6240-4c4a-8bdf-ab469e01bbbd" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>Joseph Henry</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

But Henry's experiments went further. First, he discovered that by dividing a long wire into several wires, each wrapped around an iron core and then separately connected to the battery—what we would now call parallel circuits—he could overcome limitations and create extraordinarily powerful electromagnets. He then returned to his single-wire magnet and tried connecting it to a different battery. Instead of one cell with two large metal plates immersed in acid, he used a wooden trough with 25 small cells connected in series. To his surprise, this configuration lifted even more weight when connected to a 300-meter-long wire than the magnet directly connected to the battery!

Intuitively, he realized that two different properties of electricity were at play: quantity and intensity. A quantitative battery with one large cell and a quantitative magnet wrapped with several wires produced greater mechanical force. Conversely, an intense battery with many small cells combined with an intense magnet with a single wire coil transmitted the electromagnetic effect effectively over long distances. Henry was acutely aware of the practical implications of his work, noting in his publication that it was "directly applicable to Mr. Barlow's project of creating an electromagnetic telegraph."

It would have been impolite for Henry to simply state that he had disproven Barlow, but that was indeed what he demonstrated—he conducted a demonstration at the Albany Academy, where he managed to ring a bell by transmitting electricity from an intense battery over a wire length of two and a half kilometers. His model also explained why Ronalds' telegraph worked over long distances—his frictional electrostatic generator was essentially a high-power device.

Although he did not realize it until he traveled abroad in 1837, Henry's intuitive model was already mathematically described by Georg Simon Ohm, a Bavarian-born physicist and mathematician who was teaching in Prussia at the time.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FcuNEAfciWw4xEHW2AWss%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=76279dac-5bb6-4de3-963c-20516e53972d" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

\*\*Ohm, combining meticulous experiments with mathematical imagination, carefully examined the power of various circuits using Schweiger's multiplier (by that time commonly referred to as a galvanometer). He concluded that the current (Ströme – quantity, as Henry termed it) in a circuit depends on its voltage (Spannung – intensity in Henry's terms) divided by its "reduced length" (that is, normalized to a standard wire).

Ohm's circuit model was much more complex than Henry's and was published four years before Henry's, in 1827. This publication essentially rendered Henry's work obsolete. However, Ohm's work was poorly received in Prussia, so it did not gain widespread recognition in the scientific community until the 1840s. Moreover, unlike Ohm, Henry presented his findings as a solution to the problem of long-distance telegraphy. At the time, it was not obvious that this solution was also embedded in Ohm's mathematics. Therefore, Henry's analysis of quantity and intensity had a decisive impact on the development of the telegraph.

**The Final Mile**

The battery and the new type of galvanic electricity it generated transformed work on the telegraph. It provided a new source of electricity that was more reliable and simpler than electrostatic machines, making it practical for use. It also greatly facilitated experiments with electricity, leading to the discovery of electromagnetism and a better understanding of circuits.

Early telegraph detectors relied on chemical effects of electricity or its relatively weak attraction – it could lift only a small piece of paper. The electromagnet converted electrical energy into substantial mechanical force, offering greater flexibility in the design of telegraph equipment. Henry's and Ohm's theories of current indicated which equipment would be successful and which would not.

All the key ideas for constructing an electromagnetic telegraph were now in place. It remained to find individuals with the will and resources to assemble everything and transform it into a practical system.

## Entrepreneurs

By the 1830s, it was time to develop the telegraph on a large scale. In the United States and Britain, the era of innovators was giving way to the age of entrepreneurs. New inventions first automated spinning and then weaving cotton, transforming an entire sector of the economy and gathering hundreds of unskilled workers to operate machines in vast factories. The United States and France established patent systems to encourage innovation, granting inventors temporary monopolies, while Britain improved its own system. Increasingly, joint-stock companies gained state approval to raise public funds for promising projects. Projects aimed at transforming the world through innovation were shifting from mere amusements to serious enterprises.

The rapid growth of railroads was underway. In the United States, each state sought to gain commercial advantages over its neighbors, resulting in generous land grants, debt securities purchases, and other forms of support for railroad companies. By the late 1830s, over 5,100 kilometers of railroads had been established, and by the end of the next decade, this length had more than doubled. In Britain, economic growth was fueled by private investors seeking alternatives to government bonds. Enthusiasm for railroads peaked in 1845-46, but the market eventually crashed, leaving behind not only dozens of bankrupt companies but also thousands of kilometers of railroads.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2F2Q5JlgOr9fhDTL37ryh0%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=dbbeee14-1751-46fe-964b-9b590bea4f64" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>The Liverpool-Manchester Railway Opening (1830)</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

Railroads and the telegraph grew in symbiosis. Railroad networks provided ready-made infrastructure for telegraph wires. Thanks to the telegraph, railroads could better coordinate trains, prevent congestion and accidents, and increase capacity.

This environment attracted many individuals, both in Europe and the United States, who hoped to take the telegraph from laboratories and lecture halls and integrate it into the real world.

**Schilling**

You may recall that in the early 1800s, Samuel Thomas von Sommering from Bavaria created an intriguing telegraph that used bubbles produced by the electrolysis of water (separation into hydrogen and oxygen) to denote letters. This story is crucial as it played a significant role in the development of the first commercial electric telegraph.

In 1810, Sommering was visited by Baron Pavel Lvovich Schilling—a Baltic German by origin, Russian diplomat, Orientalist historian, and electrical engineer working in the Russian embassy in Bavaria. Schilling was impressed by Sommering's device and sought to establish an electric telegraph in the Russian Empire. At that time, France and Russia were allies under the Treaty of Tilsit (1807), but tensions were already beginning to rise. Napoleon insisted that Alexander I participate in the Continental Blockade, which aimed to exclude Britain from all commercial activities on the European mainland. Unable to cope with the economic impact of the blockade, Russia withdrew from the treaty in the same year as Schilling's visit. Schilling hoped that the telegraph would help Russia coordinate its forces in the event of a French invasion.

Schilling was unable to complete the telegraph in time to meet Napoleon's crossing of the Neman River in 1812, although he did develop a method for remote electrical detonation of mines. He worked on the telegraph concept for the next decade but made little progress until the mid-1820s, when he developed a device that used a galvanometer as a detector. It featured a single needle suspended from wires, with parasitic oscillations suppressed by mercury. A disk on the wire was painted white on one side and black on the other. When the current caused the needle to rotate, it displayed one side of the disk to the recipient depending on the direction of the current flow. Each letter was encoded using a set of such black-and-white signals—one of many systems that anticipated Morse code.

By 1835, Schilling demonstrated his device at a meeting of naturalists in Bonn, where among others was Georg Münke, a professor of natural philosophy at Heidelberg University. Impressed by what he saw, Münke ordered a copy of Schilling's telegraph to use in demonstrations during his lectures at the university. Schilling managed to attract the interest of Nicholas I in building a 12 km line between the Peterhof Palace and the Kronstadt Fortress \[Note: The first optical telegraph line in Russia, connecting St. Petersburg and Kronstadt, was constructed in 1833 under the direction of French engineer Jacques Chaptal – translator's note]. Unfortunately, Schilling died in 1837 before he could complete his project and build a long-distance telegraph line in his country.

**Cook and Wheatstone**

However, the encounter between Schilling and Münke proved fruitful. Shortly after, William Cook, the son of an English surgeon, arrived in Heidelberg for training. Cook had served five years in the army in India before returning to Europe due to illness. He attended Heidelberg University to learn about making anatomical models, in which he excelled. However, he became captivated by a new project after seeing a telegraph demonstration in March 1836. He wrote twenty years later:

"It happened that I witnessed one of the widespread applications of electricity for telegraphic experiments, which had been repeated with little practical benefit for nearly fifty years. Realizing that this device could be used with a benefit beyond illustrating lectures, I immediately abandoned my anatomical studies and devoted all my efforts to inventing a practical electric telegraph…"

The following year, Cook worked on various telegraph designs but struggled with the "Barlow problem"—he could not get his inventions to work over long distances. He sought help from Britain's greatest scientific minds, starting with Michael Faraday. Faraday attempted to rid himself of this seemingly madman as quickly as possible, especially after Cook mentioned another project involving a perpetual motion machine. Cook then turned to Peter Barlow, secretary of the Royal Society (now best known for his "Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases"), who recommended Charles Wheatstone. Their first meeting took place in February 1837.

Wheatstone made a living by making musical instruments and also worked as a professor of experimental philosophy at the newly established Royal College of London. He was also experimenting with the electric telegraph. Interested in Cook's proposals, Wheatstone and Cook verbally agreed to a partnership in March. By May, they had jointly applied for an English patent for the electric telegraph and signed a formal agreement on November 7.

Here we enter a contentious territory, as the contributions of each inventor became the subject of heated debate after their falling out in 1840. We will not judge them here, but one interesting question remains: how did Cook and Wheatstone overcome the "Barlow problem" of achieving electromagnetic effects over long distances? On March 4, 1837, Cook wrote that he and Wheatstone were still stuck on the issue that "electric fluid loses its magnetic properties over long stretches." However, by the time they filed their patent in May, they already had a telegraph working over long distances.

How did they make this leap? Integrating the available evidence into a coherent narrative can be done in various ways, but the most plausible explanation is as follows. As we saw in the previous article, they needed a circuit theory that explained the configuration of equipment required to send a signal over a long wire. Two theories existed: the mathematical model of Georg Ohm and the descriptive model of Joseph Henry.

On April 1, 1837, Joseph Henry visited Wheatstone at the Royal College. Henry was on a scientific tour of Europe at the time. He wrote that Wheatstone explained Ohm’s law to him and showed a French translation of Ohm's 1835 work. Henry shared his experiments with Wheatstone, particularly how he used a high-intensity (high-voltage) circuit and long length to control a quantitative circuit (with high current) using a powerful electromagnet.

Some claim that this meeting was pivotal and that Wheatstone, after listening to Henry, understood the significance of Ohm's law for the telegraph. However, it is likely, according to Henry, that Wheatstone already recognized the applicability of Ohm's law to the telegraph—specifically, the need for a "high-intensity" battery with many cells connected in series to send current over long wires. Certainly, there is a temptation to imagine Wheatstone, quickly bidding farewell to Henry, rushing to his laboratory to modify the telegraph—with Silliman’s Journal, where Henry’s work was published, in one hand and the translation of Ohm’s work in the other.

The design that Cook and Wheatstone settled on for their patent consisted of five circuits, each controlling a needle in the same way as Schilling’s telegraph. A clever keyboard, developed by Wheatstone, was used to rotate two needles so that their intersection pointed to one of twenty letters (rare letters such as Q were omitted). In the absence of a code, neither the sending nor the receiving party required special skills. However, the cost outweighed ease of use, and the five-needle design was used only in the very first lines constructed. After that, the partners switched to a system with two, and later with one needle, encoding letters through a series of left and right turns.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2Fd87LDjpLevnpgEGEfnNg%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=db48fde8-2611-4e13-830f-ac73525ffb3b" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A year after starting their collaboration, Cook and Wheatstone secured their first client, the Great Western Railway. The railway company agreed to lay a trial line for five needles between Paddington in central London and West Drayton, covering a distance of 24 km. After that, progress was slow, though they did find a few more railways willing to construct small test lines. It wasn't until 1842 that the Great Western Railway agreed to extend the line an additional 10 km to Slough, and another year later to Windsor.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FIeXfanvcusg5SchwG68v%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=aadce15f-2574-41ab-b324-c13626f709d9" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>Passenger Locomotive Argus on the Great Western Railway</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

Meanwhile, Cook and Wheatstone successfully defended their patent against Edward Davey and William Alexander, their compatriots who had proposed their own version of the telegraph, thereby securing a monopoly on telegraphy in the United Kingdom for the foreseeable future. Interest in their device was further stimulated by two notable events: a message from Windsor about the birth of Queen Victoria's child and the capture of a murderer attempting to escape from Slough to the capital on a Great Western Railway train. Soon, new contracts followed, including a major one—a 50 km line for the Admiralty, which agreed to test the electric telegraph nearly three decades after Francis Ronalds had been bluntly rejected.

The partnership between Cook and Wheatstone began to deteriorate in 1840 when disputes arose over who deserved the credit for the invention. Each genuinely believed that the other was merely assisting him. In hindsight, both were integral to the extended development of various electrical ideas that evolved over several decades. Yet, without individuals like Cook and Wheatstone, the telegraph might have remained merely a "demonstration device during lectures," as Cook remarked.

Their device operated for several decades, under the aegis of the Electric Telegraph Company, with Cook as its director, until 1870. That year, the government took control of all electric telegraphs in the country, transferring them to the postal service, as had already occurred on the continent. Wheatstone returned to his scientific and technical pursuits and soon played a key role in the development of underwater telegraph cables.

**Gauss, Weber, and Steinheil**

The first electric telegraph used for practical message transmission was, perhaps, one of the strangest. It was constructed by the renowned mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss and his partner, physicist Wilhelm Weber, working in Göttingen, then part of the Kingdom of Hanover.

Gauss and Weber had been collaborating on electricity and magnetism for many years, and in 1832, they conducted an in-depth study of geomagnetism—the structure of the Earth's magnetic field. To facilitate this, they built a circuit 2.5 kilometers long, stretched across rooftops between their two workplaces: Gauss's observatory and Weber's physical laboratory. One can imagine the local residents' astonishment at the mysterious wires.

The scientists soon realized they could use the line they had constructed for other types of collaborative work, such as encoding letters in the signal. The system was unlike anything else, primarily because it was a scientific experiment that accidentally turned into a message transmission device. Firstly, electricity was generated not galvanically but through electromagnetic induction, a recently discovered effect in which a magnetic field can produce an electric current. The sender of the message moved a wire coil along a magnet, generating a current in the wire. The receiver's device consisted of a long magnet suspended inside a tightly wound coil on the other side of the wire. However, the magnet's deflections were extremely small, so the system required a third component—a telescope. Pointed at a mirror connected to the rotating magnet, it helped read the magnet's position on a scale. Each letter was encoded as a sequence of movements left/right on the scale.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FgiuXtro3SU8rjAn6Sy66%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a8edfd67-04ae-4ada-905c-7773d0d130cd" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>Gauss and Weber's Telegraph</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

Gauss and Weber regularly used their telegraph until December 1837, when the death of William IV ended the union between the crowns of England and Hanover. The new Hanoverian ruler, Ernest Augustus, abolished the liberal constitution and demanded that civil servants (including university professors) swear allegiance to him. Weber was among several Göttingen University staff who signed a protest letter, resulting in their dismissal. Weber moved to Leipzig. Gauss found the letter pointless and did not sign it, although the absence of his signature meant a painful separation from his daughter. He remained in Göttingen until his death in 1855.

Apparently, Gauss and Weber, focused on philosophical research, did not have the time or inclination to expand the use of their telegraph. However, in 1835, Carl Steinheil, a professor of mathematics and physics in Munich, visited them. He had known Gauss since his student days in Göttingen, and upon seeing the telegraph, he was struck by its potential, particularly its value as a signaling device for the expanding European railways.

Within a year, he created his own version of the telegraph. He retained the magnet for generating current in the wire but replaced the heavy, unwieldy magnet and telescope with two signaling needles. Unlike the Clark and Wheatstone system, both needles were controlled by a single circuit, so they moved in opposite directions relative to the current. Each needle was connected to an ink-drawing device. When a needle turned to the right, it struck a paper tape moving clockwise. By sending electrical impulses in one direction or another, sequences of coded dots could be recorded in two rows. Different sequences of upper and lower dots represented letters and numbers from 0 to 9. To facilitate learning the code, Steinheil devised sequences that resembled letters.

B. Morse</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

Throughout the 1830s, telegraph developers converged on the use of two-signal codes (though not binary in the strictest sense as spaces also mattered). Before this period, developers had attempted to represent letters directly: using a separate wire for each letter or synchronizing dials. The first approach was expensive, while the second was slow. If a dial rotated every 30 seconds, the average wait time between letters would be 15 seconds. The coded system avoided these issues, as the two-signal code was the simplest possible, and electrical circuits provided a clear method of conveying signals: by reversing the direction of current.

To demonstrate the practicality of his system, Steinheil established a 10 km line between the Royal Academy in central Munich and the Royal Observatory in the suburb of Bogenhausen, including several branches. In 1838, the Bavarian government sponsored an 8 km test line on the Nuremberg-Fürth railway but decided the venture was too costly.

**Morse and Vail**

And finally, we arrive at the name that immediately springs to mind when discussing the telegraph: Samuel F. B. Morse.

In 1832, Morse, an artist known for his portraits, was returning from France with a new dream of creating a gallery featuring all the renowned paintings of the Louvre in a single panorama accessible to an American audience. On the ship, he happened to dine with Charles Jackson, a doctor from Boston, and they discussed the latest discoveries in electricity and electromagnetism. Jackson noted that Benjamin Franklin had long demonstrated that electricity could travel through a wire of any length. Morse later recalled his epiphany: “If the presence of electricity can be demonstrated anywhere in the circuit, I see no reason why electricity could not convey information.”

Upon returning to the United States, Morse focused on this project, disregarding the fact that others had already created or were in the process of creating electric telegraphs. He worked on it for the next five years, while also advancing his career as an artist and teaching at the newly established New York University. Then, in 1837, three events compelled him to devote all his efforts to the telegraph.

First, Morse’s attempt to establish himself as a nativist failed. He believed in the destiny of the American empire and thought that the influx of Germans, Irish, and other "inferior" people threatening this destiny. He considered these "hermaphrodites" more loyal to the Pope or their native countries than to America, thereby bringing discord. In 1836, motivated by political beliefs, Morse accepted the nomination from the Native American Democratic Association for the mayor of New York. However, he finished last in the election, receiving 1,500 votes compared to 16,000 for the winner, Democrat S. W. Lawrence.

The next failure struck Morse even deeper, as he had long aspired to become a celebrated historical painter. He wanted to immortalize the greatness of America as Rubens had immortalized Ancient Greece in his fresco "The School of Athens." His main avenue for achieving this was four paintings for the rotunda of the Capitol. Before leaving for Europe, Morse had hoped to be selected for this task, but in the spring of 1837, the decision was made without including him among the four chosen artists.

While still reeling from this disappointment, Morse faced another blow. On April 15, 1837, his brother’s newspaper reprinted an article about two Frenchmen, Gonnon and Serval, who had arrived in the United States to demonstrate a telegraph. They claimed it would revolutionize message transmission, delivering messages from New York to New Orleans in 30 minutes. It turned out that the Frenchmen were promoting an optical telegraph similar to one created by the Chappe brothers in France. But Morse believed they had revealed his great idea and rushed to gather evidence to prove his priority and complete his work on the telegraph.

After this turmoil, Morse regained his self-confidence. He would not leave a mark in history as a great artist or politician – he would be a great inventor. He dedicated himself entirely to the telegraph project. By this time, it should be clear that attributing the invention of the telegraph solely to Morse was absurd. There was no single inventor. What was central to Morse's work was not the invention of the device itself, but his 1) perseverance through many years of rejection and disappointment, and 2) skill in choosing partners.

The version of the telegraph that Morse had by 1837 is the only invention that can be clearly attributed to him. It was not implemented in practice for reasons that would soon become apparent.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FQNA7uxc8BQeZUPV3uoUT%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=0ad38ecf-4ecb-4f81-8074-5316147b08c3" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>Morse Telegraph Diagram of 1837</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

At the bottom of Morse's diagram illustration, we see the sending device, a ruler holder. The sender created a message by inserting several metal pins into a wooden ruler and then moving it under the sending needle. The needle, moving up and down through the pins, interrupted and completed the telegraph circuit. In such a scheme, preparing a message like "How are you?" would have been quite laborious.

At the top is the receiver with a canvas. A handle, suspended from a string, is attached to a piece of metal. When the circuit is closed, the electromagnet pulls the handle and drags it across the paper below. A mechanical system of gears and weights advances the roll of paper under the handle, causing each movement to leave a mark in the shape of a "V". The sequence of marks represents a number associated with a word or phrase in the codebook.

Morse was aware that his device was clumsy and was even embarrassed to show it to people. He also had a more serious issue—the "Barlow problem". His telegraph worked over a wire length of no more than 12 meters. However, he soon found partners who could help him resolve both the mechanical and electrical problems of the telegraph.

To address the distance issue, Morse turned to his colleague from New York University, Professor of Chemistry Leonard Gale. Gale immediately understood the cause of Morse's equipment issues, having read Joseph Henry's 1831 paper on "intensive" batteries and electromagnets and their application in telegraphy. He replaced Morse's single-cell battery with a 40-cell battery and created a magnet with a tightly wound coil. Soon, Morse was able to demonstrate a telegraph at the university working over a distance of up to 500 meters.

After the demonstration, Morse was approached by a former student and experienced mechanic, Alfred Vail. In exchange for a quarter of the revenue from the invention, Vail agreed to create a new model of the telegraph (using funds from his family's Speedwell Iron Works in New Jersey) suitable for practical use. Vail replaced the ruler with a simple switch operated by a lever with a button, known as the "key". He simplified the receiver mechanism and replaced the handle with a block with a spring and a thickening that made marks on the paper.

**Morse's Efforts and the Telegraph's Expansion**

**The Push for Government Support:** Samuel Morse was determined to secure a government contract for his telegraph system. Early in 1837, the U.S. House of Representatives was considering a telegraph line from New York to New Orleans, initially envisioning an optical system. The Secretary of the Treasury sought information and proposals for telegraph systems. Morse responded with a proposal for an electric telegraph, promising it would be cheaper, more secure, and reliable under any conditions.

At this time, the U.S. was engaged in a debate about government involvement in infrastructure investments. The Whig Party, led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay, supported such investments to stimulate commerce and unite the vast American continent. In contrast, Jacksonian Democrats, led by Andrew Jackson, opposed these expenditures, viewing them as potential sources of corruption and favoritism.

Morse fought for Congressional approval for nearly six years, during which he traveled to Europe for patents and potential partners and learned about competitors. He faced setbacks in Europe; the Attorney General of England and Wales denied his patent request. Although he found a loophole in France, it was insignificant without government contracts, which controlled all French telegraphs. Despite attracting interest from various politicians, including Lord Elgin and agents of Nicholas I, no agreements for telegraph construction were finalized.

**Breakthrough with the Morse Code:** Undeterred, Morse continued refining his telegraph. He discovered the work of George Steinhaeuser and convinced himself that only his telegraph operated on a single circuit and had a recording device (a feature he believed was crucial to prevent message loss). He was mistaken, as Steinhaeuser’s telegraph also had these capabilities. The confusion might have arisen from Steinhaeuser’s use of two needles, leading Morse to think it used two circuits.

Before his European tour, Morse developed his famous code: a two-signal encoded alphabet. Unlike others, Morse used the duration of electrical impulses rather than their direction, simplifying the equipment and operation. This choice eliminated the need for a switch to change current direction and made it easier for operators.

**The Congressional Grant:** In 1843, Morse secured a $30,000 grant from Congress to build a trial line from Washington, D.C. to Baltimore. The line was completed in May 1844, just before the Democratic convention in Baltimore. The initial demonstration, transmitting the message "What hath God wrought," did not impress much. However, the ability to relay news from the convention created a sensation among Washington's political class, providing rapid updates over several kilometers.

**Political Changes and Business Strategy:** The success of the Democratic convention candidate in the subsequent presidential election shifted the political climate. Neither the newly elected James Polk nor his Democratic Congress was interested in internal infrastructure investments, focusing instead on annexing Texas, New Mexico, California, and Oregon. The future of the Baltimore-Washington experiment seemed uncertain, prompting Morse to seek private investors.

Morse, who preferred to sell his patent rights to the government rather than engage in business, handed this task to his new partner, Amos Kendall, a former U.S. Postmaster General with strong connections. Kendall established the Magnetic Telegraph Company and handled the investment search, legal lobbying, and expansion efforts. Under his efforts, wooden poles and copper wires spread across the U.S., starting from the coasts to Philadelphia, New York, Boston, and then westward.

**Expansion and Impact:** Laying telegraph wires proved far cheaper than railroad tracks, allowing the telegraph network to surpass railroads, connecting New Orleans to San Francisco before the railroads did. By 1850, the U.S. had over 16,000 km of telegraph lines. The development of this network accelerated with the Mexican-American War, as Eastern cities needed timely news about the conflict sparked by Polk's expansionist policies. The telegraph primarily served commercial purposes, especially for financial transactions, transmitting commodity prices and stock market updates. It became the nation’s extensive commercial nervous system, working alongside the railroad’s circulatory system.

Morse and Vail's system emerged as the most popular worldwide, overshadowing competitors like Cook and Wheatstone, and Steinhaeuser. The reasons for this success likely include the vast growth of the American continent and the simplicity of Vail's equipment and Morse's code. An adjustment made post-factum involved abandoning the recording device Morse had deemed essential, as operators found they could understand and transcribe messages more efficiently by listening to the sound of the telegraph rather than switching between the recorded code and handwritten text.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FgBRp4lJ6jEvVMIlTVYCE%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=ba8b1260-61c3-4907-87cd-e535504aa211" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>The Non-Recording Sound Receiver</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

Among all these intersecting stories, it is impossible to pinpoint a single moment or person who invented the telegraph. This is an oversimplified version of the history, which does not include figures like Davy, Bain, Alexander, and Dyar, or events such as Gauss's visit to Sommering, Schilling's visit to Gauss, and Morse's discussions with Henry. Ultimately, Samuel Morse became the principal driving force behind the creation of the line between Washington and Baltimore in 1844. As this line laid the foundation for the American telegraph network, Morse received the lion’s share of the credit for the telegraph.

Regardless of its origins, the creation of the electric telegraph was perceived by contemporaries as a pivotal moment in human history, on par with railroads and steam engines, all of which collectively annihilated space and time. Decades later, Henry Adams wrote that “he and his troglodyte Boston of the eighteenth century were suddenly cut off… his new world was ready for use, and his eyes could see only fragments of the old one.”

Henry Thoreau approached these developments with more skepticism, noting in his book _Walden, or Life in the Woods_ that the telegraph and its companions were merely “improved means to achieve an unmodified end.” I believe both perspectives hold truth. Despite the hopes of many, including Morse himself, the telegraph did not bring about a moral transformation of society. Improving information transmission did not unite humanity or create global peace—instead, it had the opposite effect. Nonetheless, the telegraph transformed politics, commerce, warfare, and more.

The history of the telegraph can be traced through various pathways. One could follow the history of entrepreneurship—conflicts between the Magnetic Telegraph Company and its competitors, the formation of Western Union, failed attempts to control the telephone, and more. Alternatively, one might focus on the technical developments that expanded the telegraph system—duplex for two-way communication over a single wire, Edison’s quadruplex, stock tickers, underwater cables. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect is the social and political impact of the telegraph in journalism, finance, empire management, and other areas.

However, despite the impression it creates, this is not the full story of the telegraph. Thus, we must part ways with these narratives and wish the telegraph well in its journey. We must rewind to the 1830s to find the true origin of the telegraph's development—the relay.

## Finally, the Relay

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FCvzKIxZUMKjyTmT1YaPl%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=7abb3173-48dc-443f-a65e-5fdcaa857b53" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the previous part of our narrative, we learned how American scientist and educator Joseph Henry made his way through Europe. During his visit to London, he made a special trip to see the highly respected mathematician Charles Babbage. Accompanied by his friend, Alexander Bach, and his new acquaintance, fellow telegraph experimenter Charles Wheatstone, Henry was introduced to Babbage’s plans. Babbage shared his intention to soon demonstrate his calculating machine to a Member of Parliament and also revealed his new machine, which he believed would significantly surpass the capabilities of the first. Henry recorded the details of this plan in his diary:

"This machine is divided into two parts, one of which Mr. B. calls the store, and the other the mill. The store is filled with wheels marked with numbers. Periodically, levers pull these wheels and move them to the mill, where the necessary manipulations occur. Eventually, this machine will be able to tabulate any algebraic formula."

**All Articles in the Series:**

Historians cannot help but feel a shiver at such fortuitous intersections in human lives. Here, two strands of the history of computing intersect—one nearing its end and the other just beginning.

Although Babbage’s machine is often presented as the beginning of the history of modern general-purpose computers, the connection between them is quite tenuous. His machine (which he never built) was the culmination of a dream of mechanical computation—a dream first articulated by Leibniz and inspired by increasingly complex timepieces created by artisans since the end of the Middle Ages. Yet, no general-purpose computer was built purely on mechanical principles; the task was simply too complex.

In contrast, the electromagnetic relay conceived by Henry and others could be readily incorporated into computing circuits, whose complexity without it would seem unimaginable. However, this development was still decades away, and Henry and his contemporaries could not foresee such an evolution. The relay became the precursor to countless transistors, making possible today’s digital world, so deeply intertwined with modern life. Relays filled the interiors of early programmable computing machines, which ruled briefly until they were replaced by their purely electronic successors.

Relays were independently invented several times during the 1830s, with various goals (at least three different applications were conceived by five inventors)—as well as diverse examples of use. However, it is convenient to think of it as a dual-purpose device. It can function as a switch controlling another electrical device (including, importantly, another relay) or as an amplifier transforming a weak signal into a strong one.

**The Switch**

Joseph Henry combined deep knowledge of natural philosophy, mechanics, and an interest in mechanical telegraphy. In the 1830s, such a combination of qualities was likely only matched by Wheatstone. By 1831, he had built a circuit 2.5 kilometers long capable of operating a bell using one of the most powerful magnets available. Perhaps if he had continued his work on the telegraph with the same vigor demonstrated by Morse, his name might have been recorded in textbooks.

However, Henry, a teacher at the Albany Academy and later at New Jersey College (now Princeton University), built and refined electrical devices for research, teaching, and scientific demonstrations. He was not interested in turning a pedagogical tool into a message transmission system.

Around 1835, he devised a particularly ingenious demonstration using two circuits. Recall that Henry had discovered two dimensions of electricity—intensity and quantity (which we now call voltage and current). He created circuits with intense batteries and magnets for transmitting electromagnetism over long distances and circuits with quantitative batteries and magnets for generating powerful electromagnetic forces.

His new device combined both properties. A powerful quantitative electromagnet could lift loads weighing hundreds of kilograms. An intense magnet at the end of a long circuit was used to lift a small metal wire: a switch. Closing the intense circuit caused the magnet to lift the wire, which opened the switch and the quantitative circuit. The quantitative electromagnet would then suddenly drop its load with a deafening crash.

This relay—specifically, the role played by the intense magnet and its wire—was necessary to demonstrate the transformation of electrical energy into mechanical energy and how a small force could control a large one. A light immersion of the wire in acid to close the circuit resulted in a slight movement of a small switch, culminating in a catastrophic fall of metal sufficient to crush anyone foolish enough to stand underneath. For Henry, the relay was a tool for demonstrating scientific principles. It was an electrical lever.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FjvGOJD9E8p0evm3EZXn8%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=96ffc48f-dd06-41bd-a202-17e68677b313" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Henry was likely the first to connect two circuits in such a way that electromagnetism in one circuit controlled another. The second place, as far as we know, belongs to William Cook and Charles Wheatstone, although their objectives were quite different.

In March 1836, shortly after attending a demonstration in Heidelberg of a telegraph that used a galvanic needle to transmit signals, Cook was inspired by a music box. Cook believed that using needles to represent letters in a practical telegraph would require multiple needles and several circuits. Instead, he wanted the electromagnet to activate a mechanism that could be as complex as needed to display the required letter.

He envisioned a machine similar to a music box, with a barrel surrounded by numerous pins. A circular scale with letters was to be placed on one side of the barrel. Each end of the telegraph line would have such a box. A wound spring would cause the barrel to rotate, but it would be held in place by a catch for most of the time. Pressing the telegraph key would close the circuit, activating the electromagnets to release both catches, causing both boxes to rotate. When the desired letter appeared on the scale, releasing the key would allow the catches to engage again and stop the barrels. Unknowingly, Cook had recreated a chronometric model of Ronald's telegraph, devised two decades earlier, and the early experiments of the Shapp brothers with telegraphs (though they used sound for synchronization of scales instead of electricity).

Cook realized that a similar mechanism could solve a long-standing problem of the telegraph—informing the receiving party of a new message. A second circuit with a different electromagnet could be used to activate a mechanical bell. Closing the circuit would retract the catch, causing the bell to ring.

In March 1837, Cook began working with Wheatstone on the telegraph, and around this time they considered the need for a second circuit. Rather than creating a separate circuit for notification signals (and running extra kilometers of wire), wouldn't it be simpler to use the main circuit to control the signal?

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FsBjnV5AEhdIRuUpkaeMK%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=80eac857-7281-4bfb-abde-060d2e4f5a18" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

By the time Cook and Wheatstone returned to the needle-based design, it became clear that a small piece of wire could be connected to a needle so that, when its end was attracted by an electromagnet, its tail would close a second circuit. This circuit would then activate a signal. After a certain interval, during which the recipient of the message could wake up, turn off the signal, and prepare pen and paper, the needle could then be used to transmit the message in the usual manner.

Over the course of two years, across two continents, and with two different goals, people had realized twice that an electromagnet could be used as a switch to control another circuit. However, another method of interacting between two circuits could also be imagined.

#### Amplifier

By the autumn of 1837, Samuel Morse was confident that his idea of an electric telegraph could work. Using a powerful battery and Henry's magnet, he was able to send messages over a distance of half a kilometer. However, to prove to Congress that his telegraph could transmit messages across the entire continent, he needed much more. It was clear that regardless of the battery power, there would come a point where the circuit would become too long to transmit a discernible signal to the other end. Morse realized that, despite the significant power drop with distance, an electromagnet could open and close another circuit powered by its own battery, which could then relay the signal further. This process could be repeated as many times as necessary to cover any length of distance. Thus, these intermediate magnets were called "relays"—much like postal stations for changing horses. They received the electric message from the weakening partner and carried it further with renewed strength.

It is impossible to determine whether this idea was inspired by Henry's work, but Morse was certainly the first to use relays for this purpose. For him, a relay was not a switch but an amplifier capable of converting a weak signal into a strong one.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2Fa9GZ8oJHFqZz8C9ssXpG%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=85b3af16-d4e9-4358-a411-a47c33a5aa67" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

On the other side of the Atlantic, around the same time, Edward Davy, a London pharmacist, came up with a similar idea. He likely became interested in the telegraph around 1835. By early 1837, he was regularly conducting experiments with a one-and-a-half-kilometer circuit in Regent's Park, northwest London.

Shortly after the meeting between Cook and Wheatstone in March 1837, Davy felt the competition and began seriously considering the construction of a practical system. He observed that the deflection of the galvanic needle decreased noticeably as the length of the wire increased. As he wrote many years later:

"I then thought that even the slightest movement of the needle, to the thickness of a hair, would be sufficient to bring two metallic surfaces into contact, closing a new circuit dependent on a local battery; and so this could be repeated indefinitely."

Davy termed this idea of converting a weak electrical signal into a strong one as the "electric regenerator." However, he was unable to realize this or any other telegraph-related idea. He received a patent for the telegraph in 1838, independent of Cook and Wheatstone. But by 1839, he had sailed to Australia to escape an unhappy marriage, leaving the field to his competitors. Their telegraph company acquired his patent a few years later.

#### Relays in the World

In the history of technology, we often focus on systems but frequently overlook their components. We trace the history of the telegraph, telephone, and electric light, showering their creators with praise. Yet, these systems could only emerge through the combination, recombination, and modification of existing elements that quietly grew in the background.

The relay is one such element. It quickly evolved and diversified as telegraph networks began to expand rapidly in the 1840s and 1850s. Over the subsequent century, it appeared in various electrical systems. The earliest modification involved using a rigid metal anchor, similar to the telegraph signal, to close the circuit. After the electromagnet was turned off, the anchor would detach from the circuit using a spring. This mechanism proved more reliable and durable than pieces of wire or needles. Additionally, designs were developed for normally closed relays, in addition to the original normally open design.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FDeNOPm1KF9Pewq0kOiDF%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=56b35dae-9094-4e2f-b65c-409bc2b01e7d" alt=""><figcaption><p>A typical late 19th-century relay. The spring T holds the armature B away from contact C. When the electromagnet M is activated, it overcomes the spring and closes the circuit between wire W and contact C.</p></figcaption></figure>

In the early years of telegraphy, relays were rarely used as amplifiers or "refreshers" since a single circuit could be stretched up to 150 kilometers. However, they were highly useful for combining low-voltage long lines with local high-voltage lines, which could power other devices, such as Morse's register.

Numerous patents from the latter half of the 19th century in the United States describe new types of relays and their applications. The differential relay, which split the coil so that the electromagnetic effect was canceled in one direction and amplified in the other, enabled duplex telegraphy: two signals traveling in opposite directions over a single wire. Thomas Edison utilized the polarized (or polar) relay to create a quadruplex system capable of sending four signals simultaneously over one wire: two in each direction. In a polarized relay, the armature itself was a permanent magnet that responded to the direction of the current rather than its strength. Thanks to permanent magnets, relays could have switching contacts that remained either open or closed after switching.

In addition to telegraphy, relays began to be used in railway signaling systems. With the advent of power transmission networks, relays were also employed in these systems, especially as protective devices.

However, even these extensive and complex networks did not demand more from relays than they were capable of providing. Telegraphy and railroads reached every city, but not every building. They had tens of thousands of endpoints but not millions. Power transmission systems, on the other hand, did not care where they ended—they simply provided current to the local circuit, and every home and business could draw as much as needed.

Telephony was an entirely different matter. Telephones needed to establish connections from point to point, from any home or office to any other, which required control circuits on an unprecedented scale. The human voice, transmitted as oscillations through wires, was a rich but weak signal. Therefore, long-distance telephony required amplifiers of superior quality. It turned out that relays could also function as amplifiers. Thus, telephone networks became the major force driving the evolution of relays more than any other system.

## The Speaking Telegraph

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2F6HeP9cElP9JiD9fbtXsH%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=134edd8b-54e6-46d4-b40e-2fe3bda09c71" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The telephone did not come about entirely by chance, but its creation was the result of efforts to improve existing telegraphic technologies. The telegraph networks of the 1840s were built upon a century of research into the possibilities of transmitting messages via electricity, and the telephone emerged from attempts to enhance these systems. Thus, the year 1876, marking the centennial of the founding of the United States, is a plausible date for the invention of the telephone.

**Predecessors of the Telephone**

The telephone did not appear in isolation. Since 1830, scientists had been exploring ways to convert sound into electricity and vice versa.

**Electric Sound**

In 1837, Charles Page, a physician and electromagnetism experimenter from Massachusetts, discovered an unusual phenomenon. He placed an isolated spiral wire between the poles of a permanent magnet and immersed the ends of the wire in mercury-filled containers connected to a battery. Each time he opened or closed the circuit by raising or lowering the end of the wire, the magnet emitted a sound audible at a distance of about one meter. Page referred to this phenomenon as "galvanic music" and hypothesized that it was related to "molecular disorder" within the magnet. These experiments sparked a wave of research into two areas: the study of metal materials changing shape under magnetization and the more apparent generation of sound through electricity.

**Johann Philipp Reis**

Particularly noteworthy is the work of Johann Philipp Reis, a mathematics and science teacher at the Garnier Institute near Frankfurt. In his spare time, Reis conducted electrical experiments. He developed a device capable of converting sound into electricity and vice versa. His first prototype, built in 1860, consisted of a wooden "ear" with a membrane made from a pig's bladder. This membrane vibrated, opening and closing an electrical circuit connected to a battery. As a receiver, Reis used a wire coil wrapped around a knitting needle, which was mounted on a violin. The violin body amplified the vibrations of the needle, which was magnetized and demagnetized, converting sound waves into electrical signals.

Johann Philipp Reis made numerous improvements to his early prototype. Along with other experimenters, he found that singing or humming into the device allowed the transmitted sound to remain recognizable. However, distinguishing words was more challenging, as they often became distorted and unclear. Common phrases such as "good morning" and "how are you" were frequently used in successful voice transmissions, as they were easier to guess. The primary issue was that Reis's transmitter only opened and closed the circuit without regulating sound intensity. Consequently, it could only transmit a fixed-amplitude frequency, failing to capture the nuances of the human voice.

Reis believed his work deserved scientific recognition but never achieved it. His device became a popular curiosity among the scientific elite, with copies appearing in major centers such as Paris, London, and Washington. However, his scientific work was rejected by Professor Poggendorff’s journal, "Annalen der Physik"—one of the oldest and most influential scientific journals of the time. Reis's attempts to promote the telephone through telegraph companies also failed. Suffering from tuberculosis, his worsening condition prevented further serious research. Ultimately, in 1873, the disease claimed his life and ambitions. This would not be the last time that tuberculosis hindered the development of the telephone.

While Reis was refining his telephone, Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz was completing his influential study on auditory physiology: "On the Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music" \[Die Lehre von den Tonempfindungen als physiologische Grundlage für die Theorie der Musik], published in 1862. Helmholtz, a professor at Heidelberg University at the time, was a giant of 19th-century science, contributing to physiology of vision, electrodynamics, thermodynamics, and more.

Helmholtz's work, while tangential to our story, is too significant to overlook. In "On the Sensations of Tone," Helmholtz did for music what Newton did for light—he demonstrated how a seemingly singular sensation could be broken down into its components. He showed that differences in timbre, from a violin to a bassoon, are due solely to variations in the relative strength of their overtones (tones at double, triple, and higher frequencies relative to the fundamental note). For our narrative, the most intriguing aspect of his work is the remarkable instrument he developed to demonstrate these principles:

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2F67ugcFcFYZdceaBmcFyx%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=f3cd7fe3-f6a5-498e-bea2-51fd1a0a4727" alt=""><figcaption><p>Helmholtz's Harmonic Telegraph</p></figcaption></figure>

Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz designed and ordered a harmonic telegraph from a workshop in Cologne. Simply put, it was a synthesizer capable of producing sounds based on the combination of simple tones. Its most remarkable feature was its ability to reproduce vowel sounds, which were typically only heard from the human mouth.

The synthesizer operated using a fundamental tuning fork that vibrated at a base note, opening and closing a circuit by immersing a platinum wire into a mercury bath. Eight magnetized tuning forks, each vibrating at its own overtone, were positioned between the poles of an electromagnet connected to the circuit. Each circuit closure energized the electromagnets, maintaining the tuning forks in a vibrating state. Adjacent to each tuning fork was a cylindrical resonator capable of amplifying its buzz to audible levels. Normally, the resonator's cover was closed, muffling the tuning fork’s sound. By moving the cover aside, the overtone could be heard, thus "playing" sounds akin to a trumpet, piano, or the vowel "o."

This device would play a small role in the development of a new type of telephone.

**The Harmonic Telegraph**

One of the attractions for inventors in the latter half of the 19th century was the multi-telegraph. The more telegraph signals that could be squeezed into a single wire, the more efficient the telegraph network became. By the early 1870s, several methods for duplex telegraphy (simultaneous sending of two signals in opposite directions) were known. Soon after, Thomas Edison enhanced these methods by creating the quadruplex system, combining duplex and diplex (simultaneous transmission of two signals in one direction), allowing a wire to be used four times more efficiently.

Could the number of signals be further increased? Could an octoplex or even more be developed? The fact that sound waves could be converted into electrical signals and back offered an intriguing possibility. What if different tones could be used to create an acoustic, harmonic, or, poetically speaking, musical telegraph? If physical vibrations of varying frequencies could be translated into electrical signals and then separated into their original frequencies on the other end, it would be possible to transmit multiple signals simultaneously without interference. The sound itself would then serve merely as a medium, forming currents to allow several signals to exist on a single wire. For simplicity, I will refer to this concept as the harmonic telegraph, though various terms were used at the time.

This was not the only method for creating multiplexed signals. In France, Jean Maurice Émile Baudot (after whom the unit of baud rate is named) developed a machine with a rotating distributor by 1874, which sequentially collected signals from multiple telegraph transmitters. Today, we would call this time-division multiplexing rather than frequency-division multiplexing. However, this approach had a drawback—it did not lead to the development of telephony.

By this time, Western Union dominated American telegraphy, having formed in the 1850s to eliminate the detrimental competition between several large telegraph companies. Before the advent of antitrust legislation, such explanations were often used to justify such mergers. One character in our story described Western Union as "probably the largest corporation that ever existed." With thousands of miles of wire and enormous expenditures on building and maintaining networks, Western Union closely followed developments in multiplex telegraphy.

Another key player in the telegraph industry was Gardiner Green Hubbard, a Boston lawyer and entrepreneur who was a major proponent of transferring American telegraphy under federal control. Hubbard believed that telegrams could be as inexpensive as letters and sought to undermine what he saw as the cynical and extortionate monopoly of Western Union. Hubbard’s bill did not propose fully nationalizing existing telegraph companies, as was done by nearly all European powers, but rather establishing a government-sponsored telegraph service under the Post Office Department. The result would likely have been similar, with Western Union exiting the business. By the mid-1870s, progress on the bill had stalled, but Hubbard was confident that control over a critical new telegraph patent could give him the advantage needed to push his proposal through Congress.

#### Gardiner Green Hubbard

In the United States, two unique factors shaped the telegraph industry: first, the continental scale of Western Union. No European telegraph organization had such extensive lines, and thus, no similar impetus for developing multiplex telegraphy. Second, the unresolved issue of government control over telegraphy remained. Britain was the last European stronghold to nationalize telegraphy in 1870. After that, the only place left with a tantalizing prospect of achieving a technological breakthrough and disrupting the monopoly was the United States. Consequently, much of the work on harmonic telegraphy was conducted in the U.S.

Three main contenders emerged for the prize. Two of them were seasoned inventors—Elisha Gray and Thomas Edison. The third was a professor of rhetoric and teacher for the deaf, Alexander Graham Bell.

**Elisha Gray**

Elisha Gray grew up on a farm in Ohio. Like many of his contemporaries, he tinkered with telegraphy as a teenager, but at 12, after his father's death, he began searching for a vocation that could support him. For a time, he worked as an apprentice blacksmith and then as a ship’s carpenter. At 22, he discovered that he could receive an education at Oberlin College while continuing his work as a carpenter. After five years of study, he embarked on a career as an inventor in the field of telegraphy. His first patent was for a self-adjusting relay, which used a second electromagnet instead of a spring to return the armature, eliminating the need to adjust the relay's sensitivity based on the current in the circuit.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FX68zls7z4LH246MkuCyU%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=764cb54e-ea68-4cb2-b4b0-54af41887ef2" alt=""><figcaption><p>Elisha Gray, c. 1878</p></figcaption></figure>

By 1870, Elisha Gray was a partner in a company manufacturing electrical equipment, where he served as the chief engineer. In 1872, he and his partner relocated the company to Chicago and renamed it Western Electric Manufacturing Company. Soon, Western Electric became the primary supplier of telegraph equipment for Western Union, leaving a significant mark on the history of telephony.

In early 1874, Gray heard a peculiar sound emanating from his bathroom. It resembled the howling of a vibrating reotome, but much louder. A reotome (literally "current breaker") was a well-known electrical device that used a metallic tongue to rapidly open and close a circuit. Upon investigating, Gray found his son holding an induction coil connected to the reotome with one hand while rubbing the zinc-coated bathtub with the other, causing it to hum at the same frequency.

Intrigued by this discovery, Gray decided to step away from his daily work at Western Electric to return to inventing. By the summer, he had developed a full-octave musical telegraph, which allowed sounds to be played on a diaphragm made from a metal basin by pressing keys on a keyboard.

**The Musical Telegraph**

The musical telegraph was a novel invention with no apparent commercial value. However, Gray recognized that the ability to transmit sounds of different pitches over a single wire offered him two opportunities. With a differently designed transmitter capable of capturing sound from the air, he could create a voice telegraph. With a different receiver able to separate the combined signal into its components, he could develop a harmonic telegraph—a multiplex telegraph based on sound. He decided to focus on the latter option due to the clear demands of the telegraph industry. His decision was solidified upon learning about Reis's telephone, which appeared to be a mere philosophical toy.

Gray’s harmonic telegraph receiver was made from a set of electromagnets paired with metal strips. Each strip was tuned to a specific frequency and sounded when the corresponding button on the transmitter was pressed. The transmitter operated on the same principle as the musical telegraph.

Gray spent the next two years improving his device and took it to an exhibition. The event was officially called the "International Exhibition of Arts, Industrial Products, and Soil and Mining Products." It was the first world’s fair held in the United States and coincided with the nation’s centennial celebrations, featuring the so-called "Centennial Exposition." Held in Philadelphia in the summer of 1876, Gray demonstrated an “octoplex” connection (transmitting eight messages simultaneously) over a specially prepared telegraph line from New York. This achievement received high praise from the exhibition judges but was soon overshadowed by an even greater marvel.

**Edison**

William Orton, president of Western Union, quickly learned about Gray's progress, which caused him considerable concern. At best, if Gray succeeded, it would result in expensive patent licensing. At worst, Gray’s patent could become the foundation for a competing company, undermining Western Union’s dominance.

Thus, in July 1875, Orton played his trump card: Thomas Edison. Edison had grown up alongside telegraphy, spending several years as a telegraph operator before becoming an inventor. His highest triumph at that time was the quadruplex communication system, created with funds from Western Union the previous year. Now, Orton hoped that Edison would improve on his invention and surpass Gray’s achievements. Orton provided Edison with a description of Reis’s telephone, and Edison also studied Helmholtz’s work, which had recently been translated into English.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FEdLW6kzJXxn6A41AwZ7d%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=70d12ebb-7e8d-4197-bd6c-46d20f82bc46" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Edison was at the peak of his creativity, with innovative ideas flowing like sparks from an anvil. In the following year, he presented two different approaches to acoustic telegraphy. The first approach was similar to Gray's telegraph and used tuning forks or vibrating reeds to create or perceive the required frequency. However, Edison was unable to make this apparatus work at an acceptable level.

The second approach, which he called the "acoustic transmitter," was entirely different. Instead of using vibrating reeds to transmit various frequencies, he used them to transmit pulses with different intervals. He divided the use of the wire between transmitters by time rather than by frequency. This required perfect synchronization of vibrations in each transmitter-receiver pair to prevent signal overlap. By August 1876, he had a working quadrupole system based on this principle, although the signal became useless over a distance of more than 100 miles. He also had ideas for improving Reis's telephone, which he temporarily set aside.

**Bell**

Alexander Graham Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and grew up in London under the attentive guidance of his grandfather. Like Gray and Edison, he developed an interest in telegraphy during his youth, but later followed in his father’s and grandfather’s footsteps, making his main passion human speech. His grandfather, Alexander, gained recognition on the stage and later taught oratory. His father, Alexander Melville, was also a teacher and even developed and published a phonetic system he called "Visible Speech." The younger Alexander (Alec, as he was known within the family) chose to focus on teaching deaf individuals to speak.

By the late 1860s, he was studying anatomy and physiology at University College London. He was accompanied by a student named Mabel Eccleston, whom he intended to marry. However, he ultimately abandoned both his studies and his romance. After the death of his two brothers from tuberculosis, Alec’s father insisted that he emigrate to the New World with the remaining family to preserve the health of his only son. Bell complied, though he was resistant and resentful, and set sail in 1870.

After a brief stint in Ontario, Alexander, leveraging his father’s connections, found work as a teacher at a school for the deaf in Boston. There, his future began to take shape.

Initially, he had a student named Mabel Hubbard, who had lost her hearing at five years old due to scarlet fever. Bell continued private tutoring even after becoming a professor of vocal physiology and elocution at Boston University, and Mabel was among his first students. During her training, she was a little less than 16 years old, ten years younger than Bell, and over the months, he fell in love with her. We will return to her story later.

In 1872, Bell rekindled his interest in telegraphy. Several years prior, while still in London, Bell had learned about Helmholtz’s experiments. However, Bell misunderstood Helmholtz’s achievement, thinking that he had not only created but also transmitted complex sounds using electricity. Thus, Bell became captivated by harmonic telegraphy—the simultaneous use of a wire for multiple signals transmitted at different frequencies. Perhaps inspired by news that Western Union had acquired the idea of duplex telegraphy from Joseph Stearns, a fellow Bostonian, Bell reconsidered his ideas and, like Edison and Gray, began to work on realizing them.

One day, while visiting Mabel, Bell inadvertently touched the second thread of his fate. Standing next to a piano, he demonstrated a trick he had learned in his youth. If a pure note was sung to the piano, the corresponding string would resonate and play it back. He told Mabel’s father that a tuned telegraph signal could achieve the same effect and explained how this could be used in multiplex telegraphy. And Bell found an ideal listener: Mabel’s father, Gardiner Hubbard, who resonated with joy and immediately grasped the main idea: “The air is common to all, and only one wire is needed,” meaning that the wave propagation of current in a wire could miniaturely replicate the propagation of sound waves in the air.

**The Telephone**

Now the story becomes quite complex, so I’ll try to trace the main trends without getting bogged down in details.

Supported by Hubbard and another student’s father, Bell diligently worked on the harmonic telegraph without disclosing his successes. He alternated intense work with periods of rest due to health issues, trying to balance his university duties, promote his father’s “Visible Speech” system, and continue tutoring. He hired a new assistant, Thomas Watson, an experienced mechanic from the Boston mechanical workshop of Charles Williams, where individuals interested in electricity gathered. Hubbard pushed Bell, even using his daughter’s hand as motivation, refusing to marry her off until Bell perfected his telegraph.

In the summer of 1874, while resting near his family home in Ontario, Bell experienced a moment of inspiration. Several thoughts in his subconscious merged into one— the telephone. His thinking was influenced in part by the phonautograph—the world’s first sound recording device that traced sound waves on smoked glass. This convinced Bell that sound of any complexity could be reduced to movements of a point in space, such as the movement of current through a wire. We won’t linger on the technical details, as they are not relevant to the phones actually created and their practical application is questionable. But they guided Bell’s thinking in a new direction.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2F4vEpt6e4CkBHPku8SUyC%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d7ce4ef3-2c7b-4daf-9b11-4ae2ba38d37b" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>Initial Concept of Bell’s Telephone with “Harmonics” (Unbuilt)</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

Bell temporarily set aside this idea to, as his partners expected, pursue the creation of the harmonic telegraph.

However, the routine of precise instrument adjustment soon became tiresome, and Bell’s heart, weary from the many practical obstacles standing between a working prototype and a practical system, increasingly leaned towards the telephone. The human voice was his first passion. In the summer of 1875, he discovered that vibrating reeds could not only rapidly open and close a circuit like a telegraph key but could also create a continuous wave-like current when moving in a magnetic field. He shared his telephone idea with Watson, and together they built the first model of a telephone based on this principle—a vibrating diaphragm in the field of an electromagnet generated a wave-like current in the magnet’s circuit. This device was capable of transmitting some muffled sounds of the voice. Hubbard was not impressed with the device and instructed Bell to return to real tasks.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FnczMhzrqhOEtchdDStqm%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=4e3f4d43-9b82-4c02-95a9-102701b026a3" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>Bell’s Rudimentary Telephone of Summer 1875</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

Despite the rudimentary nature of the device, Bell convinced Hubbard and other partners that the idea should be patented, as it could be used in multiplex telegraphy. And if a patent application was to be filed, no one could prevent mentioning the device’s potential for voice communications.

In January, Bell updated the patent draft to include a new wave current generation mechanism: variable resistance. He envisioned connecting the vibrating diaphragm, which received sound, to a platinum contact that would move up and down within a container of acid, in which another stationary contact was placed. As the moving contact submerged deeper, it would expose a larger surface area to the acid, thus reducing the resistance of the current flowing between the contacts—and vice versa.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FpbsQLvZtlHLLvHSvZaJq%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=2db3c7e5-41de-4a3e-bb8d-216ea4cdbc6f" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>Bell’s Concept for the Liquid Variable Resistance Transmitter</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

Hubbard, aware that Gray was closing in on Bell, filed the wave current patent application with the patent office on the morning of February 14, without waiting for Bell’s final approval. Later that same day, Gray’s lawyer arrived with his patent application, which also proposed generating wave currents using liquid variable resistance. It similarly mentioned the potential applications for both telegraphy and voice transmission but arrived a few hours too late to obstruct Bell’s patent. Had the order of arrival been reversed, lengthy hearings on priority would have been necessary before granting the patent. Consequently, on March 7, Bell was granted patent number 174,465 for “Improvements in Telegraphy,” which laid the cornerstone for Bell’s future dominance.

However, there is a touch of irony in this dramatic story. Neither Bell nor Gray had built a working telephone model by February 14, 1876. In fact, no one had attempted to do so, aside from Bell’s brief attempt the previous July, which lacked any variable resistance mechanism. Therefore, patents should not be seen as milestones in the history of technology. This critical moment in the development of telephony as a business enterprise was almost unrelated to the telephone as a device.

Only after the patent application did Bell and Watson have the opportunity to return to the telephone, despite Hubbard’s ongoing demands to continue work on the multiplex telegraph. Bell and Watson spent several months trying to make the liquid variable resistance idea work, and the telephone based on this principle was used to transmit the famous phrase: “Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you.”

However, the inventors continually faced reliability issues with these transmitters. As a result, Bell and Watson began working on new transmitters using the magneto principle they had experimented with in the summer of 1875—using the movement of a diaphragm in a magnetic field to directly induce a current. The advantage was simplicity and reliability. The drawback was that the low power of the telephone signal was due to the vibrations of the air created by the speaker’s voice, which limited the effective working distance of the magneto transmitter. In contrast, the liquid variable resistance device allowed the voice to modulate the current generated by the battery, which could be made as strong as needed.

The new magnetos worked much better than those from the previous summer, and Gardner decided that there might indeed be something to the telephone idea. Among other activities, he was involved in the Massachusetts Committee on Education and Scientific Exhibitions for the upcoming Centennial Exposition. He used his influence to secure Bell a spot at the exhibition and in the competition where judges assessed electrical inventions.

The judges arrived at Bell's demonstration immediately after examining Gray's harmonic telegraph. Bell left them with the receiver and moved to one of the transmitters positioned a hundred meters down the gallery. The judges were astonished to hear his singing and words emanating from a small metal box. Among the judges was Bell's compatriot, the Scottish scientist William Thomson (later honored with the title Lord Kelvin). In joyful excitement, Thomson rushed to the other end of the hall to inform Bell that he had heard his words and later declared the telephone to be "the most remarkable thing he had seen in America." Also present was the Emperor of Brazil, who, after first pressing the box to his ear, jumped up from his chair exclaiming, "I hear, I hear!"

The commotion caused by Bell's demonstration at the exhibition prompted Edison to revisit his earlier telephone transmission ideas. He immediately focused on addressing the primary drawback of Bell's device – the weak magneto transmitter. From his experiments with the quadruplex, Edison knew that the resistance of carbon powder varied with pressure. After numerous experiments with different configurations, he developed a variable resistance transmitter based on this principle. Instead of using a moving contact in a liquid, the pressure waves of the speaker's voice compressed a carbon "button," altering its resistance and thus the current in the circuit. This approach proved to be much more reliable and simpler to implement compared to the liquid-based transmitters conceived by Bell and Gray, and it became a decisive factor in the long-term success of the telephone.

Despite the clear advantages in experience and skills possessed by his competitors, Bell was the first to create the telephone. He was not the first because he had a sudden revelation that eluded others—Bell’s competitors also conceived the idea of the telephone but considered it insignificant compared to improvements to the telegraph. Bell was first because he preferred the human voice to the telegraph, so much so that he resisted his partners' wishes until he managed to prove the telephone’s viability.

As for the harmonic telegraph, to which Gray, Edison, and Bell dedicated so much effort and thought? It yielded no successful results. Maintaining mechanical vibrators at both ends of the wire perfectly tuned proved very challenging, and no one knew how to amplify the combined signal for long-distance transmission. It wasn’t until the mid-20th century, when electrical technologies such as radio allowed for precise frequency tuning and low-noise amplification, that the concept of transmitting multiple signals over a single wire became a reality.

**Farewell to Bell**

Despite the success of the telephone at the exhibition, Hubbard was not interested in building a telephone system. That winter, he offered William Orton, President of Western Union, $100,000 for all rights to the telephone patent. Orton declined, influenced by a combination of dislike for Hubbard and his postal telegraph schemes, confidence in his own capabilities and Edison’s work on the telephone, and a belief that the telephone was of little significance compared to the telegraph. Other attempts to sell the telephone idea also failed, primarily due to fears of the enormous costs associated with patent litigation in case of commercialization. Thus, in July 1877, Bell and his partners founded the Bell Telephone Company to establish a telephone service independently. In the same month, Bell finally married Mabel Gardiner at her family home, having become successful enough to win her father's blessing.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FfNQFoYGegdW6CNkCa3jl%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=edc8e7cb-21fe-49e1-afe8-2f92a7e9561c" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>Alex with his wife Mabel and two surviving children – two of his sons died in infancy (around 1885)</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

The following year, Orton changed his stance on the telephone and established his own company, the American Speaking Telephone Company, anticipating that the patents of Edison, Gray, and others would shield the company from Bell’s legal challenges. This posed a serious threat to Bell’s interests. Western Union had two main advantages. First, substantial financial resources. Bell's company needed funds as it leased equipment to its clients, which meant that it took many months for the investment to become profitable. Second, access to Edison’s improved transmitter. Anyone who compared his transmitter with Bell’s device could not fail to notice the superior clarity and loudness of the former. Bell’s company had no choice but to sue the competitor for patent infringement.

If Western Union had unequivocal rights to the only available high-quality transmitter, it would have had a powerful lever for negotiation. However, Bell’s team uncovered an earlier patent for a similar device, obtained by German immigrant Emil Berliner, and acquired it. Only after many years of legal battles was Edison’s patent granted precedence. Seeing that the litigation was unproductive, in November 1879, Western Union agreed to transfer all patent rights to the telephone, equipment, and the existing subscriber base (55,000 people) to Bell’s company. In exchange, they requested only 20% of the rental income from telephones for the next 17 years and that Bell refrain from entering the telegraph business.

Bell’s company quickly replaced Bell’s devices with improved models, initially based on Berliner’s patent and later on patents acquired from Western Union. By the time the litigation ended, Bell’s primary activity was testifying in patent lawsuits, of which there were plenty. By 1881, he had completely stepped away from the business. Like Morse, and unlike Edison, he was not a system creator. Theodore Vail, an energetic manager whom Gardiner had lured from the postal service, took over the company and led it to a dominant position in the country.

Initially, the telephone network grew quite differently from the telegraph network. The latter developed in leaps from one commercial center to another, covering 150 km at a time, seeking points of highest concentration of valuable clients, and only then adding connections to smaller local markets. Telephone networks grew like crystals from small growth points, from a few clients located in independent clusters in each city and its surroundings, and slowly, over decades, merged into regional and national structures.

There were two main obstacles to large-scale telephony. First, there was the issue of distance. Even with enhanced variable resistance transmitters based on Edison’s idea, the range of the telegraph and telephone was incomparable. The more complex telephone signal was more susceptible to noise, and the electrical properties of fluctuating currents were less well understood compared to the constant current used in telegraphy.

Second, there was the problem of connection. Bell’s telephone was a one-to-one communication device; it could connect two points over a single wire. This was not an issue for the telegraph. One office could serve many clients, and messages could be easily redirected from the central office via another line. However, there was no simple way to transmit a telephone conversation. In the initial version of the telephone, a third person and subsequent people could connect with the two conversing individuals only through what would later be called a "party line." That is, if all subscriber devices were connected to one line, each could speak (or listen in) to the others.

We will return to the issue of distance in due course. In the next section, we will delve into the problem of connections and their impact on the development of the relay.

## Just Connecting

The first telephones operated one-on-one, connecting one pair of stations. But by 1877, Alexander Graham Bell envisioned a universal communication system. Bell wrote in a promotional piece for potential investors that just as municipal networks for gas and water connect homes and offices in large cities with distribution centers:

_“One can imagine how telephone wires will be laid underground or suspended above, with branches extending to private homes, country estates, stores, factories, etc., connecting them via a main cable to a central office, where wires can be connected in any configuration to establish a direct connection between any two locations in the city. Furthermore, I believe that in the future, wires will connect the headquarters of the Telephone Company in different cities, allowing a person from one part of the country to communicate with another person from a distant location.”_

**All Articles in the Series:**

However, neither Bell nor his contemporaries had the technical means to realize these forecasts. It would take entire decades, substantial genius, and hard work to transform the telephone into the most extensive and complex machine known to humanity, spanning continents and eventually oceans, to connect any telephone station in the world with any other.

This transformation was made possible, among other things, by the development of the switch – a central office with equipment capable of redirecting calls from the calling line to the receiving line. The automation of switches led to a significant increase in the complexity of relay circuits, which had a profound impact on computers.

**Early Switches**

In the early days of the telephone, no one could definitively say what it was for. Transmitting recorded messages over long distances had already been mastered and proved useful in commercial and military applications. But there were no precedents for transmitting sound over long distances. Was it a business tool like the telegraph? A device for social communication? A means for entertainment and education, such as broadcasting music and political speeches?

Gardiner Green Hubbard, one of Bell’s primary backers, found a useful analogy. Entrepreneurs in the telegraph industry had established numerous local telegraph companies over the previous decades. Wealthy individuals or small businesses rented dedicated telegraph lines connecting them to the company's central office. By sending a telegram, they could call a taxi, dispatch a courier with a message to a client or friend, or summon the police. Hubbard believed that the telephone could replace the telegraph in such matters. It was much easier to use, and the ability to maintain voice contact would accelerate service and reduce misunderstandings. Thus, he encouraged the creation of a company offering phone rentals connected to local telephone companies, both newly formed and converted from telegraph stations.

A manager of one of these telephone companies might notice that he needed twenty telephones to talk to twenty clients. In some cases, one client wanted to send a message to another – for example, a doctor sending a prescription to a pharmacist. Why not simply enable them to communicate with each other?

Bell himself might have proposed such an idea. Most of 1877 was spent on lecture tours promoting the telephone. George Coy attended one such lecture in New Haven, Connecticut, where Bell expounded on his vision of a central telephone office. Coy was inspired by the idea, organized the New Haven District Telephone Company, acquired a license from Bell’s company, and found initial subscribers. By January 1878, he had connected 21 subscribers using the first public telephone switch, crafted from used wires and teapot handles.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FSucuZ51mWMZkoGn8z9Io%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a17fa495-99b4-4158-82ac-4d468b3630fd" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Over the course of the year, similar makeshift communication devices for local telephone subscribers began appearing across the country. A speculative social model of telephone usage began to crystallize around these nodes of local communication—between vendors and suppliers, businessmen and clients, doctors and pharmacists. Even among friends and acquaintances who were wealthy enough to afford such a luxury. Alternative uses of the telephone (such as for broadcasting) gradually fell out of favor.

Within a few years, telephone offices converged on a common scheme for switchboard equipment that would persist for many decades: a matrix of jacks that an operator could connect using plug-in wires. They also agreed on an ideal setup for the operator. Initially, telephone companies, many of which had evolved from telegraph companies, hired workers from the available labor pool—young clerks and messengers. However, clients complained about their rudeness, and managers suffered from their unruly behavior. Soon, they were replaced by polite, respectable young women.

The further development of these central switchboards would determine the contest for dominance in telephony between the Goliath-like Bell company and the emerging independent competitors.

**Bell and Independent Companies**

The American Bell Telephone Company, holding Bell's 1876 patent number 174,465 for "improvements in telegraphs," was in an extremely advantageous position due to the broad scope covered by the patent. The court ruled that this patent included not only the specific tools described but also the principle of transmitting sound through electrical waves, giving Bell a monopoly on telephony in the U.S. until 1893, when the 17-year term of the patent expired.

The company's managers wisely utilized this period, particularly notable were President William Forbes and Theodore Vail. Forbes, a Boston aristocrat and leading investor who took control of the company when Bell’s early partners ran out of funds, and Vail, a grand-nephew of Samuel Morse's partner Alfred Vail, who was president of the key Bell company, Metropolitan Telephone, in New York, and chief manager of American Bell. Vail demonstrated his managerial skills as head of the Railway Mail Service, sorting mail in transit, considered one of the most impressive logistical feats of its time.

Forbes and Vail focused on establishing Bell in all major cities across the country and connecting these cities with long-distance lines. Since the company's most valuable asset was its existing subscriber base, they believed that unrivaled access to Bell's existing clients would provide an overwhelming competitive advantage in acquiring new subscribers after the patent expired.

Bell entered new cities not under the American Bell name, but by licensing its patents to a local operator and purchasing a controlling interest in the company through a deal. To further advance and expand lines connecting urban offices, they established another company, American Telephone and Telegraph (AT\&T), in 1885. Vail added the presidency of this company to his impressive list of roles. Perhaps the most significant addition to the company’s portfolio was the acquisition in 1881 of a controlling stake in the Chicago-based electrical equipment company, Western Electric. Founded by Bell's rival, Elisha Gray, it had become the main supplier of equipment for Western Union before eventually becoming a manufacturer for Bell.

Only in the early 1890s, as Bell's legal monopoly neared its end, did independent telephone companies begin to emerge from the corners Bell had driven them into with the club named Patent No. 174,465. Over the next twenty years, independent companies posed a serious threat to Bell, and both sides quickly expanded in their battle for territories and subscribers. To spur expansion, Bell performed a corporate sleight of hand, turning AT\&T from a private company into a holding company. American Bell was incorporated under Massachusetts laws that followed the old model of a corporation as a limited public charter, requiring American Bell to seek state legislative approval to enter a new city. AT\&T, organized under New York’s liberal corporate laws, did not face such requirements.

AT\&T expanded networks and founded or acquired companies to consolidate and protect its claims on major urban centers, continuously extending its growing network of long-distance lines across the country. Independent companies rapidly captured new territories, especially in small towns not yet reached by AT\&T.

During this intense competition, the number of telephones in use grew at an astonishing rate. By 1900, there were already 1.4 million telephones in the U.S., compared to 800,000 in Europe and 100,000 worldwide. There was one telephone for every 60 Americans. Besides the U.S., only Sweden and Switzerland came close to such density. Out of the 1.4 million telephone lines, 800,000 belonged to Bell subscribers, while the rest were with independent companies. Within just three years, these numbers grew to 3.3 million and 1.3 million, respectively, and the number of switchboards approached tens of thousands.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FiB6WWLFzyDQ7DUv6HW71%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=9c4dd923-16b9-4b47-a941-40c246ef2e54" alt=""><figcaption><p>Number of Switchboards, c. 1910</p></figcaption></figure>

The growing number of switchboards placed an even greater burden on central telephone stations. In response, the telephone industry developed a new technology for switching, which branched into two main parts: one favored by Bell, operated by human operators, and another adopted by independent companies, utilizing electromechanical devices to eliminate operators entirely.

For convenience, we’ll refer to this as the divide between manual and automatic switching. However, let this terminology not be misleading. Just as with "automatic" checkout counters in supermarkets, electromechanical switchboards, especially their early versions, imposed an additional burden on customers. From the perspective of telephone companies, automation reduced labor costs, but from a system standpoint, it shifted the cost of operator labor onto the user.

**Operators Awaiting Calls**

During this competitive era, Chicago emerged as a major hub of innovation for the Bell System. Angus Hibbard, the general manager of Chicago Telephone, was pushing the boundaries of telephony to extend the service to a broader user base—much to the dismay of AT\&T headquarters. However, since there was not a strong connection between AT\&T and its operating companies, AT\&T could only watch and disapprove.

By this time, most Bell customers were merchants, business leaders, doctors, or lawyers who paid a fixed amount for unlimited telephone service. Few could afford to pay $125 per year, equivalent to several thousand dollars today. To expand the service to a larger number of customers, Chicago Telephone introduced three new offerings in the 1890s with lower costs and reduced service levels. The first was a time-based service with access for multiple users, where costs were calculated with a per-minute rate and a very small subscription fee (due to sharing a line among several users). Operators recorded customer usage on paper—a true automatic counter in Chicago only emerged after World War I. Next was a service for local exchanges, with unlimited calls within several blocks but fewer operators per customer (resulting in longer connection times). Finally, there was the payphone service, installed at home or office, where a five-cent coin allowed a call lasting up to five minutes anywhere in the city. This was the first telephone service accessible to the middle class, and by 1906, 40,000 out of 120,000 phones in Chicago were payphones.

To keep up with the rapidly growing subscriber base, Hibbard worked closely with Western Electric, whose main factory was also located in Chicago, particularly with Charles Scribner, its chief engineer. While Scribner is not widely remembered today, he was a well-known inventor and engineer at the time, having authored several hundred patents. Among his early achievements was the development of a standard switchboard for the Bell system, which included a connector for the operator's wire, named the "jackknife" due to its resemblance to a folding pocket knife. The name was later shortened to "jack."

Scribner, Hibbard, and their teams redesigned the central switchboard to increase operator efficiency. Signals for "busy" and "revenue" (indicating the receiver had been lifted) freed operators from informing callers of errors. Small electric lamps indicating active calls replaced the latches that operators had to reset each time. The operator’s greeting of “hello,” which invited conversation, was replaced with “number, please,” implying only one response. These changes reduced the average connection time for local calls in Chicago from 45 seconds in 1887 to 6.2 seconds by 1900.

**Typical Switchboard with Operators, circa 1910**

While Chicago Telephone, Western Electric, and other Bell affiliates worked to make operator-assisted connections faster and more efficient, others sought to eliminate operators altogether.

**Almon Brown Strowger**

Devices for connecting phones without human intervention had been patented, demonstrated, and implemented since 1879 by inventors from the United States, France, Britain, Sweden, Italy, Russia, and Hungary. By 1889, 27 patents for automatic telephone switchboards had been registered in the U.S. alone. However, as has often happened throughout history, the credit for inventing the automatic switchboard was unfairly given to just one man: Almon Strowger. This attribution isn’t entirely wrong, as previous inventors created one-off devices, treated them as novelties, couldn't break into small, slowly growing telephone markets, or simply failed to capitalize on the idea. Strowger's machine became the first to be implemented on an industrial scale. Yet, even calling it "Strowger's machine" isn’t entirely accurate, as he never actually built it.

Strowger, a 50-year-old schoolteacher turned entrepreneur from Kansas City, was hardly the typical innovator of an era of increasing technical specialization. The stories of his invention of the switchboard have been told many times, often sounding more like myths than solid facts. But all these stories revolve around Strowger’s frustration that operators at his local telephone exchange were redirecting his customers to a competitor. Whether such a conspiracy actually existed and whether Strowger was truly a victim of it is lost to history. It’s more likely that Strowger wasn’t as good a businessman as he thought. In any case, out of this situation came the idea of a phone system "without the girls."

His 1889 patent described a device where a rigid metal arm replaced the graceful hand of the telephone operator. Instead of holding a cord with a plug, the arm held a metal contact that could move in an arc and select one of 100 different subscriber lines (either in a single plane or, in a "two-motor" version, across ten planes, each with ten lines).

The caller controlled the arm using two telegraph-style keys, one for tens and the other for units. To connect to subscriber 57, the caller would press the tens key five times to move the arm to the correct group of ten subscribers, then press the units key seven times to reach the desired subscriber within that group, and finally press the connect key. With an operator-assisted phone, the caller only needed to lift the receiver, wait for the operator to answer, say "57," and wait to be connected.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FRJoI9D9Yunc9kQjNDtMx%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=78ce1012-f8f3-46bb-9d99-ac0947489d8f" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The system was not only cumbersome to use but also required excessive equipment: five wires from the subscriber to the switchboard and two batteries for the phone (one for controlling the switchboard and the other for conversations). By that time, Bell was already transitioning to a centralized battery system, and their latest exchanges had no batteries and only one pair of wires.

Strowger is said to have built the first model of the switch using pins stuck into a stack of starched collars. To develop a practical device, he needed the financial and technical help of several key partners, notably businessman Joseph Harris and engineer Alexander Keith. Harris provided the funding and oversaw the creation of the Strowger Automatic Telephone Exchange Company, which manufactured the switches. Wisely, he decided to base the company not in Kansas City but in his hometown of Chicago, which was the center of telephone engineering due to the presence of Western Electric. Among the first engineers hired was Keith, who had come from the world of electricity generation and became the technical director of Strowger Automatic. With the help of other experienced engineers, he turned Strowger's crude concept into a precise instrument ready for mass production and use and oversaw all major technical improvements to the instrument over the next 20 years.

Among these improvements, two were particularly significant. The first was replacing the multiple keys with a single rotary dial, which automatically generated both the impulses that moved the switch to the correct position and the connection signal. This greatly simplified subscriber equipment and became the default mechanism for controlling automatic switchboards until Bell introduced touch-tone dialing in the 1960s. The automatic telephone became synonymous with the rotary phone. The second improvement was the development of a two-stage switching system, allowing first 1,000 and later 10,000 users to connect by dialing 3 or 4 digits. The first-level switch selected one of ten or one hundred second-level switches, and that switch then selected the desired subscriber from 100 options. This made automatic switchboards competitive in large cities with thousands of subscribers.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2Fmd7cAoLfXzTZyLHDV5os%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=cc2dcd55-33ce-4e9d-bbd3-06ad8e182717" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Strowger Automatic established the first commercial switchboard in LaPorte, Indiana, in 1892, serving eighty subscribers of the independent Cushman Telephone Company. A former Bell branch operating in the city had conveniently exited after losing a patent dispute with AT\&T, giving Cushman and Strowger a perfect opportunity to take over and attract its customers. Five years later, Keith oversaw the first installation of a two-level switchboard in Augusta, Georgia, serving 900 lines.

By that time, Strowger had retired and was living in Florida, where he passed away a few years later. His name was removed from the Automatic Telephone Company's title, and it became known as Autelco. Autelco became the primary supplier of electromechanical switches in the U.S. and much of Europe. By 1910, automatic switchboards served 200,000 American subscribers across 131 telephone exchanges, almost all built by Autelco. Each was owned by an independent telephone company. However, 200,000 subscribers were a small fraction of the millions of telephone users in America. Even most independent companies followed Bell's lead, and Bell itself had yet to seriously consider replacing its operators.

#### Centralized Management

Opponents of the Bell system tried to attribute the company's commitment to using operators to some malicious motives, but such accusations are hard to believe. There were several good reasons for it, and one that seemed reasonable at the time but, in retrospect, appears misguided.

Bell first needed to develop its own switchboard. AT\&T was not going to pay Autelco for its telephone exchanges. Fortunately, in 1903, it acquired the patent for a device developed by the Lorimer brothers from Brantford, Ontario. It was in this city that Alexander Bell's parents had settled after leaving Scotland, and where the idea of the telephone first came to him during a visit in 1874. Unlike Strowger's switch, the Lorimer device used reverse impulses to move the selector arm—electrical impulses sent from the switchboard that triggered a relay in the subscriber's equipment, making it count down from the number set by the subscriber to zero.

In 1906, Western Electric tasked two separate teams with developing switches based on the Lorimer's idea, and the systems they created—panel and rotary—formed the second generation of automatic switchboards. Both replaced the arm with a dial device, moving the pulse receiver inside the central station.

What's more important for us is that the mechanics of Western Electric's switchboard equipment—carefully detailed by telephone historians—relied on relay circuits used for controlling switches. Unfortunately, historians only briefly mentioned this aspect.

This is regrettable because the emergence of control relay circuits has two significant implications for our story. In the long term, they inspired the idea that combinations of switches could be used to perform arbitrary arithmetic and logical operations. The implementation of these ideas will be the subject of the next article. Initially, however, they solved the last serious engineering problem of automatic switchboards—scalability to serve large urban areas where Bell had thousands of subscribers.

The method of scaling Strowger switches, used by Alexander Keith to switch between 10,000 lines, could not be extended too far. Increasing the number of levels required dedicating too much equipment to each call. Bell engineers developed an alternative scaling mechanism known as the sender. It stored the number dialed by the caller in a register, then converted that number into arbitrary (usually non-digital) codes that controlled the switches. This allowed for much more flexible routing—calls between exchanges could be routed through a central office (which didn't correspond to any digit in the dialed number) rather than connecting every exchange in the city to all others.

Apparently, Edward Molina, a research engineer in AT\&T's Traffic Division, was the first to conceive of the "sender." Molina made innovative use of mathematical probability to study telephone traffic. Around 1905, this research led him to the idea that if call routing was decoupled from the decimal number dialed by the user, the automatics could use the lines much more efficiently.

Molina mathematically demonstrated that distributing calls across larger groups of lines allowed a switchboard to handle a higher volume of calls while maintaining the same probability of a busy signal. However, Strowger switches were limited to one hundred lines, selected using two digits. Switchboards for 1,000 lines using three digits were deemed inefficient. But selector movements controlled by a sender didn't have to correspond directly to the digits dialed by the caller. Such a selector could choose from 200 or 500 lines, available in rotary and panel systems, respectively. Molina proposed a design for a call-registering and translating device built from a combination of relays and ratchets. However, by the time AT\&T was ready to implement panel and rotary systems, other engineers had already devised faster senders based solely on relays.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FrqzqkDDCYlMtZXIdHbAM%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=8d261be0-46d4-41de-ab83-90d856b7da3f" alt=""><figcaption><p>Molina's call-translating device, Patent No. 1,083,456 (filed in 1906, approved in 1914), marked a significant innovation in telephone switching technology.</p></figcaption></figure>

From the "sender" to centralized control was only a small step. The teams at Western Electric realized that it wasn't necessary to build a sender for every subscriber or even for every active call. A small number of control devices could be shared among all the lines. When a call came in, the sender would activate temporarily, record the dialed digits, work with the switchboard to route the call, and then deactivate, ready to handle the next one. With the panel switch, sender, and centralized control, AT\&T achieved a flexible and scalable system capable of meeting the demands of massive networks in cities like New York and Chicago.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2Fe5YQzCxORf9Np6pNxeRM%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=2cfc62c7-f951-49d8-9638-f4ed8b6a5530" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>Relay in the Panel Switchboard</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

Even though the company's engineers had addressed all technical objections to operator-free telephony, AT\&T's management remained skeptical. Their primary concern was whether users could handle dialing six- and seven-digit numbers necessary for automatic switching in large cities. At the time, callers would reach local switchboards and provide the operator with two key pieces of information: the name of the desired switchboard and (usually) a four-digit number. For instance, a client in Pasadena could reach a friend in Burbank by saying, "Burbank, 5553." Bell's leadership feared that replacing "Burbank" with a random two- or three-digit code would lead to a high number of misdials, customer frustration, and a decline in service quality.

In 1917, AT\&T employee William Blauvelt proposed a solution to these issues. Western Electric could print two or three letters next to each digit on the subscriber's dial. The phone directory would display the first few letters of each switchboard corresponding to its numeric code in capital letters. Instead of remembering a random numeric code for the desired switchboard, the caller could simply dial the number using the letters: BUR-5553 (for Burbank).

Even when all objections to automatic switchboards had been addressed, AT\&T still lacked the technical or operational rationale to abandon its successful method of connecting calls. The decisive push came only because of the war. The massive increase in demand for industrial goods continuously raised the cost of labor: in the United States, it nearly doubled between 1914 and 1919, leading to wage increases across other sectors as well. Suddenly, the key consideration for comparing operator-managed versus automatic switchboards shifted from technical or operational to financial. Given the rising cost of paying operators, AT\&T decided by 1920 that it could no longer resist mechanization and ordered the installation of automatic systems.

The first such system with panel switches went live in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1921. New York followed with its switchboard in October 1922. By 1928, 20% of AT\&T's switchboards were automatic; by 1934, this figure had risen to 50%, and by 1960, 97%. Bell closed its last operator-managed telephone exchange in Maine in 1978. However, operators were still needed for long-distance call management, a role from which they began to be phased out only after World War II.

Based on popular narratives about technology and business, one might assume that a lumbering AT\&T barely escaped destruction by agile, smaller independent companies, eventually adopting a seemingly more advanced technology first tested by these smaller entities. In reality, AT\&T had already paid off the threat posed by independent companies a decade before it began automating its telephone exchanges.

**The Triumph of Bell**

Two events in the first decade of the 20th century convinced much of the business community that no one could challenge the Bell System. The first was the failure of the independent United States Independent Telephone Company of Rochester, New York. United States Independent was the first to attempt building a competing long-distance communication network. However, they failed to penetrate the critical New York market and went bankrupt. The second was the collapse of Illinois Telephone and Telegraph, an independent company that tried to enter the Chicago market. Not only could these companies not compete with AT\&T in long-distance communication, but they also struggled to compete in major urban markets.

Moreover, the endorsement of Bell’s Chicago operating company (Hibbard's Chicago Telephone) by the Chicago leadership in 1907 signaled that city governments would not attempt to foster competition in the telephone industry. A new economic concept of natural monopoly emerged—the belief that consolidating certain public services under a single provider was a beneficial and natural market outcome. According to this theory, the proper response to a monopoly was public regulation, not enforced competition.

The "Kingsbury Commitment" of 1913 affirmed Bell's right to operate as granted by the federal government. Initially, it seemed that the progressive Wilson administration, which was skeptical of massive corporate combinations, might break up the Bell System or otherwise curb its dominance. This was the general assumption when Attorney General James McReynolds, serving under Wilson, reopened an antitrust case against Bell, filed under the first antitrust law, the Sherman Act, and shelved by his predecessor. However, AT\&T and the government soon reached an agreement, signed by company vice president Nathan Kingsbury. AT\&T agreed to divest Western Union (which it had acquired control of a few years earlier), cease purchasing independent telephone companies, and connect independent companies via its long-distance network at reasonable rates.

It appeared that AT\&T had suffered a severe blow to its ambitions. However, the Kingsbury Commitment only solidified its power in national telephony. Cities and states had already indicated they would not attempt to forcefully limit the telephone monopoly, and now the federal government had joined them. Moreover, granting independent companies access to the long-distance network ensured that this network would remain the only one of its kind in the U.S. until the advent of microwave networks half a century later.

Independent companies became part of the massive machine centered around Bell. The ban on acquiring independent companies was lifted in 1921, largely due to the pressure from many such companies eager to sell to AT\&T. Still, many independent companies survived and even thrived, particularly General Telephone & Electric (GTE), which acquired Autelco as a competitor to Western Electric and had its own collection of local companies. Yet, all of them felt the gravitational pull of the Bell star around which they orbited.

Despite the comfortable circumstances, Bell's directors were not content to rest on their laurels. To promote innovation in telephony and maintain its dominance in the field, AT\&T President Walter Gifford established Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1925 with 4,000 employees. Bell also soon developed third-generation automatic switchboards with step-by-step switches, controlled by the most complex relay circuits known at the time. These two developments would eventually lead George Stibitz and Claude Shannon to explore intriguing analogies between switchboard circuits and systems of mathematical logic and computation.

In our previous article, we discussed the rise of automatic telephone switches controlled by relay circuits. This time, we aim to explore how scientists and engineers developed relay circuits in the first — now largely forgotten — generation of digital computers.

**Relays at Their Zenith**

As you may recall, the operation of a relay is based on a simple principle: an electromagnet operates a metal switch. The concept of the relay was independently proposed by several naturalists and telegraph business entrepreneurs in the 1830s. By the mid-19th century, inventors and mechanics had transformed the relay into a reliable and indispensable component of telegraph networks. It was in this field that the relay reached its zenith: it was miniaturized, and generations of engineers created countless designs, formally studying mathematics and physics.

By the early 20th century, not only automatic switching systems but nearly all telephone network equipment contained various types of relays. One of the earliest applications in telephony dates back to the 1870s, in manual switchboards. When a subscriber turned the telephone crank (the magneto crank), a signal was sent to the telephone exchange, activating a "blinker." A blinker is a relay that, when triggered, caused a metal flap to fall on the switchboard, signaling an incoming call. The operator would then insert a plug into a socket, the relay would reset, and the flap could be raised again, held in place by an electromagnet.

By 1924, as noted by two Bell engineers, a typical manual telephone exchange served around 10,000 subscribers. Its equipment contained 40,000 to 65,000 relays, with a combined magnetic force "sufficient to lift 10 tons." In large telephone exchanges with machine switches, these figures were doubled. The entire telephone system in the United States used millions of relays, and their number continually increased with the automation of telephone exchanges. A single telephone connection could be managed by anywhere from a few to several hundred relays, depending on the number and sophistication of the involved exchanges.

Western Electric factories, a manufacturing arm of the Bell Corporation, produced an extensive range of relays. Engineers created so many variations that even the most discerning dog breeders or pigeon fanciers would have envied the diversity. Relay speed and sensitivity were optimized, and sizes were reduced. In 1921, Western Electric produced nearly 5 million relays of a hundred main types. The most common was the universal Type E relay, a flat, almost rectangular device weighing several dozen grams. It was mostly made from stamped metal parts, making it cost-effective to produce. The casing protected the contacts from dust and induced currents from adjacent devices: relays were usually mounted closely together in racks with hundreds or thousands of relays. In total, 3,000 variants of Type E were developed, each differing in winding and contact configurations.

Soon, these relays began to be used in the most complex switchboards.

**Coordinate Switch**

In 1910, Gotthilf Betulander, an engineer at Royal Telegrafverket — the state corporation that controlled most of the Swedish telephone market (for decades, nearly all of it) — had an idea. He believed that he could significantly improve the efficiency of Telegrafverket's operations by building automatic switching systems entirely based on relays. More specifically, on relay matrices: grids of steel rods connected to telephone lines, with relays at the intersections of the rods. This switch was supposed to work faster, more reliably, and be easier to maintain compared to systems based on sliding or rotating contacts.

Moreover, Betulander came up with the idea of separating the parts of the system responsible for selection and connection into independent relay circuits. The remaining part of the system would then only be used to establish the voice channel, and after that, it could be freed up to handle another call. In essence, Betulander came up with what would later be known as "common control."

The circuit that stored the incoming call number was called the "recorder" (another term is "register"). The circuit that found and "marked" the available connection in the grid was called the "marker." The inventor patented his system. Several such stations appeared in Stockholm and London. In 1918, Betulander learned about an American innovation: the coordinate switch created by Bell engineer John Reynolds five years earlier. This switch was very similar to Betulander's design, but it used n + m relays to service n + m nodes of the matrix, which was much more convenient for further expanding telephone stations. When establishing a connection, the holding rack clamped the "fingers" made of piano wire, and the selecting rack moved along the matrix to connect with another call. The following year, Betulander incorporated this idea into the design of his switch.

However, most engineers found Betulander's creation odd and overly complex. When it came time to choose a switching system to automate the networks of major Swedish cities, Telegrafverket preferred the design developed by Ericsson. Betulander's switches were only used in small rural telephone stations: the relays were more reliable than the motorized automation of Ericsson's switches and did not require maintenance technicians at each station.

American telephone engineers, however, had a different opinion. In 1930, Bell Labs specialists visited Sweden and were "very impressed with the parameters of the coordinate switching module." Upon returning, the Americans immediately began working on what would later become known as "Coordinate System No. 1," which replaced panel switches in large cities. By 1938, two such systems were installed in New York. Soon, they became standard equipment for urban telephone stations until more than 30 years later, they were replaced by electronic switches.

The most interesting component of Coordinate Switch No. 1 was the new, more complex marker developed at Bell. It was designed to find a free route from the caller to the called party through several interconnected coordinate modules, thus creating a telephone connection. The marker also had to test each connection for "free" or "busy" status. This required the use of conditional logic. As historian Robert Chapuis wrote:

"The choice is conditional because a free connection is held only if it provides access to a coordinate rack that has a free connection to the next level as an output. If several sets of connections meet the required conditions, then 'preferential logic' selects one of the \[existing] least numerous connections..."

Coordinate Switch No. 1 is a prime example of the mutual enrichment of technological ideas. Betulander created his fully relay-based switch, then improved it with Reynolds' switching matrix, and proved the viability of the resulting design. AT\&T engineers later reworked this hybrid switch, improved it, and created Coordinate System No. 1. This system then became a component of two early computing machines, one of which is now known as a milestone in the history of computing technology.

**Mathematical Calculations**

To understand how and why relays and their electronic cousins helped revolutionize computing technology, we need a brief excursion into the world of mathematical calculations. After this, it will become clear why there was a hidden demand for optimizing computational processes.

By the beginning of the 20th century, the entire system of modern science and engineering was based on the labor of thousands of people performing mathematical calculations. They were called computers. As early as the 1820s, Charles Babbage created the difference engine (though his device had earlier conceptual predecessors). Its primary task was to automate the creation of mathematical tables, for example, for navigation (calculating trigonometric functions using polynomial approximations at 0 degrees, 0.01 degrees, 0.02 degrees, etc.). There was also a high demand for mathematical calculations in astronomy: it was necessary to process raw results from telescope observations in specific areas of the celestial sphere (depending on the time and date of the observations) or to determine the orbits of new objects (e.g., Halley's Comet).

Since Babbage's time, the need for computing machines had grown exponentially. Power companies needed to understand the behavior of transmission systems with highly complex dynamic properties. Bessemer steel cannons, capable of firing shells beyond the horizon (and thus no longer directly targeting the observed objective), required increasingly accurate ballistic tables. New statistical tools involving large volumes of mathematical calculations (e.g., the least squares method) were increasingly used in both science and the expanding government apparatus. Computational departments, usually staffed by women, began to appear in universities, government institutions, and industrial corporations.

Mechanical calculators only eased the task of calculations; they did not solve it. Calculators sped up arithmetic operations, but any complex scientific or engineering problems required hundreds or thousands of operations, each of which the computer (person) had to perform manually, carefully recording all intermediate results.

The emergence of new approaches to the problem of mathematical calculations was facilitated by several factors. Young scientists and engineers, agonizing over their tasks late at night, wanted to give their hands and eyes a rest. Project managers had to pay increasing amounts in salaries to numerous computers, especially after World War I. Finally, many advanced scientific and engineering problems were difficult to solve manually. All these factors led to the creation of a series of computing machines developed under the guidance of Vannevar Bush, an electrical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

**Differential Analyzer**

Up until this point, history has often been impersonal, but now we will talk more about specific people. The creators of the panel switch, Type E relay, and coordinate marker circuit did not receive fame. Not even biographical anecdotes about them have survived. The only public records of their lives are the fossilized remains of the machines they created.

Now we can gain a deeper understanding of the people and their past. But we will no longer meet those who worked tirelessly in attics and workshops at home — Morse and Vail, Bell and Watson. By the end of World War I, the era of heroic inventors had almost ended. Thomas Edison can be considered a transitional figure: at the beginning of his career, he was a hired inventor, and by the end, he became the owner of an "invention factory." By that time, the development of the most notable new technologies had become the domain of organizations — universities, corporate research divisions, and government laboratories. The people we will discuss in this section belonged to such organizations.

For example, Vannevar Bush. He arrived at MIT in 1919 at the age of 29. Just over 20 years later, he became one of the people who influenced the United States' involvement in World War II and helped increase government funding, forever changing the relationship between government, academia, and the development of science and technology. But in the context of this article, we are interested in the series of machines developed in Bush's laboratory from the mid-1920s, designed to address the problem of mathematical calculations.

MIT, which had recently moved from central Boston to the Charles River waterfront in Cambridge, was closely tied to industrial needs. Bush himself, in addition to his professorship, had financial interests in several electronics enterprises. So, it should not be surprising that the problem that led Bush and his students to work on a new computing device arose in the energy industry: they needed to model the behavior of main power lines under peak loads. It was clear that this was just one of many potential applications for computing machines: tedious mathematical calculations were being conducted everywhere.

Bush and his colleagues first built two machines known as product integraphs. But the most famous and successful MIT machine was another — the differential analyzer, completed in 1931. It solved problems related to power transmission, calculated electron orbits, the trajectories of cosmic rays in the Earth's magnetic field, and much more. Researchers around the world, in need of computing power, created dozens of copies and variants of the differential analyzer in the 1930s. Some were even made from Meccano (the British equivalent of the American Erector Set children's construction kits).

The differential analyzer was an analog computer. Mathematical functions were calculated using rotating metal rods, the rotation speed of each reflecting a certain quantitative value. A motor drove an independent rod — a variable (usually representing time), which in turn, through mechanical connections, rotated other rods (different differential variables), and the function was calculated based on the input rotation speed. The calculation results were drawn on paper as curves. The most important components were the integrators — wheels that rotated on disks. The integrators could calculate the integral of a curve without tedious manual calculations.

None of the analyzer’s components contained discrete switching relays or any digital switches. So why are we discussing this device? The answer lies with the fourth machine in the family.

In the early 1930s, Vannevar Bush began seeking funding from the Rockefeller Foundation to further develop the analyzer. Initially, he failed to convince Warren Weaver, head of the foundation's natural sciences division, as engineering wasn't within Weaver's expertise. However, Bush highlighted the limitless potential of his new machine for scientific applications—particularly in mathematical biology, Weaver’s pet project. Bush also promised numerous improvements to the analyzer, including "the ability to quickly switch the analyzer from one problem to another, much like a telephone switchboard." In 1936, his efforts were rewarded with an $85,000 grant to create a new device, later named the Rockefeller Differential Analyzer.

As a practical computing machine, this analyzer wasn’t a groundbreaking success. Bush, who had become the vice president of MIT and the dean of its engineering school, couldn’t devote much time to overseeing its development. In fact, he soon distanced himself, taking on the role of chairman of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C. Bush sensed the approaching war and had several scientific and production ideas that could serve military needs, making him eager to stay close to the centers of power where he could more effectively influence decision-making.

Meanwhile, the technical problems dictated by the new design were solved by laboratory staff, who were soon distracted by war-related tasks. The Rockefeller machine was completed only in 1942. The military found it useful for the mass production of ballistic tables for artillery. However, it was soon overshadowed by purely digital computers, which represented numbers not as physical quantities but abstractly, using the positions of switches. Ironically, the Rockefeller analyzer itself used quite a few such switches, consisting of relay circuits.

#### Shannon

In 1936, Claude Shannon was only 20 years old, but he had already graduated from the University of Michigan with a bachelor's degree in both electrical engineering and mathematics. He was drawn to MIT by a flyer pinned to a bulletin board. Vannevar Bush was looking for a new assistant to work on the differential analyzer. Shannon applied without hesitation and soon began tackling fresh problems, and only then did the new device start to take shape.

Shannon was nothing like Bush. He was neither a businessman, an empire-building academic, nor an administrator. He had a lifelong love of games, puzzles, and entertainment: chess, juggling, mazes, cryptograms. Like many men of his era, during the war, Shannon devoted himself to serious work, holding a position at Bell Labs under a government contract, which protected his frail body from military conscription. His wartime research on fire control and cryptography eventually led to his foundational work in information theory (which we won't cover here). In the 1950s, after the war and its consequences had subsided, Shannon returned to teaching at MIT, spending his free time on hobbies such as a calculator that worked exclusively with Roman numerals and a machine that, when switched on, produced a mechanical hand that switched it off.

The structure of the Rockefeller machine that Shannon encountered remained logically similar to the 1931 analyzer, but it was built from entirely different physical components. Bush realized that the rods and mechanical transmissions in the old machines reduced their efficiency: setting up the machine for computations required many man-hours of skilled mechanics' work.

The new analyzer was free from this drawback. At its core was not a table of rods but a coordinate switch—an extra prototype donated by Bell Labs. Instead of transmitting power from a central shaft, each integral module was independently powered by an electric motor. To configure the machine for solving a new problem, it was enough to simply reconfigure the relays in the coordinate matrix to connect the integrators in the desired sequence. A punched tape reader (borrowed from another telecommunications device, a roll teletype) read the machine's configuration, and a relay circuit converted the signal from the tape into control signals for the matrix—similar to establishing a series of telephone calls between integrators.

The new machine was not only much faster and easier to set up but also operated more quickly and accurately than its predecessor. It could solve more complex problems. Today, this computer might seem primitive, even extravagant, but at the time, it appeared to observers as some great—or perhaps terrifying—working intellect:

> Essentially, it is a mathematical robot. An electrically powered automaton designed not only to relieve the human brain of the burden of heavy calculations and analysis but also to tackle mathematical problems beyond the reach of mental effort and solve them.

Shannon focused on converting data from paper tape into instructions for the "brain," and this operation was managed by a relay circuit. He noticed the correspondence between the circuit's structure and the mathematical structures of Boolean algebra, which he had studied in his senior year at Michigan. This is an algebra where the operands are TRUE and FALSE, and the operators are AND, OR, NOT, etc., an algebra that corresponded to logical statements.

After spending the summer of 1937 working at Bell Labs in Manhattan (the perfect place to ponder relay circuits), Shannon wrote his master's thesis titled "A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits." Alongside Alan Turing's work from a year earlier, Shannon's thesis laid the foundation for the science of computing machines.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FAxkOFwK47E3m7YYXe7pN%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d9e26896-8601-439c-bb1f-612b2bbad05c" alt=""><figcaption><p>In the 1940s and 1950s, Shannon constructed several computational/logical machines: the THROBAC calculator with Roman numeral arithmetic, a machine for chess endgames, and Theseus — a maze with an electromechanical mouse (as shown in the photo).</p></figcaption></figure>

Shannon discovered that systems of propositional logic equations could be directly mechanistically transformed into physical relay switch circuits. He concluded: “Virtually any operation that can be described by a finite number of steps using words LIKE IF, AND, OR, etc., can be automatically performed using relays.” For example, two relays connected in series form a logical AND: current flows through the main wire only when both electromagnets are activated to close the switches. Meanwhile, two relays connected in parallel form an OR: current flows through the main circuit if one of the electromagnets is activated. The outputs of such logical circuits can, in turn, control the electromagnets of other relays to achieve more complex logical operations such as (A AND B) or (C AND D).

Shannon concluded his dissertation with an appendix containing several examples of circuits created using his method. Since Boolean algebra operations closely resemble arithmetic operations in the binary system (i.e., using binary numbers), he demonstrated how to construct from relays an “electrical adder in the binary system”—what we now call a binary adder. A few months later, one of the scientists at Bell Labs built such an adder on a kitchen table.

**Stibitz**

George Stibitz, a researcher from the mathematics department at Bell Labs headquarters in Manhattan, brought home a peculiar set of equipment on a dark November evening in 1937. Dry cell batteries, two small lamps for hardware panels, and a couple of flat Type U relays found in a trash bin. By adding some wires and miscellaneous items, he assembled a device capable of adding two single-digit binary numbers (represented by the presence or absence of input voltage) and outputting a two-digit number using the lamps: one for "on" and zero for "off."

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FkYv4gemm7o1jTwaYDQkb%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=13d09e64-f1d3-4cad-af7a-4196940be5b8" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>Stibitz's Binary Adder</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

Stibitz, a physicist by training, was asked to assess the physical properties of relay magnets. Having no prior experience with relays, he started by studying their use in Bell's telephone circuits. Soon, George noticed a resemblance between some of these circuits and arithmetic operations with binary numbers. Intrigued, he assembled his side project on his kitchen table.

Initially, Stibitz's experiments with relays attracted little interest from Bell Labs management. However, in 1938, the head of the research group inquired if Stibitz’s calculators could be used for arithmetic operations with complex numbers (e.g., a + bi, where i is the square root of a negative number). It turned out that several computational departments at Bell Labs were struggling with the frequent need to multiply and divide such numbers. Multiplying one complex number required four arithmetic operations on a desk calculator, while division required 16 operations. Stibitz claimed he could solve the problem and designed a machine for these computations.

The final design, realized in metal by telephone engineer Samuel Williams, was named the Complex Number Computer — or Complex Computer for short — and went into operation in 1940. It utilized 450 relays, with intermediate results stored in ten coordinate switches. Data was entered and output via a roll-fed teleprinter. Three such teleprinters were installed in Bell Labs departments, indicating a high demand for computational power. The relays, matrix, and teleprinters all exemplified the Bell System’s technology.

The Complex Computer's moment of fame arrived on September 11, 1940. Stibitz presented a report on the computer at a meeting of the American Mathematical Society at Dartmouth College. He arranged for a teleprinter with a telegraph connection to the Complex Computer on Manhattan, 400 kilometers away, to be set up there. Attendees could approach the teleprinter, enter problem conditions on the keyboard, and see the teleprinter magically print the result in under a minute. Among those who experienced the novelty were John Mauchly and John von Neumann, each of whom would play a significant role in the continuation of this story.

The attendees glimpsed the future of computing. Later, computers became so expensive that administrators could no longer afford to have them idle while users pondered what to enter next. For the next 20 years, scientists would work on creating general-purpose computers that would always be ready to accept input, even while working on other tasks. It would take another 20 years before this interactive mode of computing became the norm.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2F7Qh4kCrprHJ9YddX0twZ%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=00a08ca7-411f-408d-b2fa-27f940f7aa4e" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>Stibitz at the Dartmouth Interactive Terminal in the 1960s</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

Dartmouth College was a pioneer in interactive computing. Stibitz became a professor at the college in 1964.

Interestingly, despite the tasks he solved, the Complex Computer, by modern standards, was not really a computer at all. It could perform arithmetic operations with complex numbers and likely solve other similar problems, but it was not a general-purpose machine. It was not programmable and could not perform operations in an arbitrary order or repeat them. It was essentially a calculator capable of performing specific computations much better than its predecessors.

With the onset of World War II, under Stibitz’s leadership, Bell developed a series of computers known as Model II, Model III, and Model IV (the Complex Computer was named Model I). Most of these machines were built at the request of the National Defense Research Committee, led by none other than Vannevar Bush. Stibitz enhanced the design of these machines to offer greater functionality and programmability.

For instance, the Ballistic Calculator (later Model III) was developed for anti-aircraft fire control systems. It was put into operation in 1944 at Fort Bliss, Texas. The device contained 1,400 relays and could execute a sequence of mathematical operations defined by instructions on a looped paper tape. Separate tapes were used for input data and tabular data. This setup allowed for quick retrieval of values, such as trigonometric functions, without actual computation. Bell engineers developed special hunting circuits that scanned the tape forward and backward to find the required tabular values independent of calculations. Stibitz determined that his Model III computer, which clicked relays day and night, replaced 25 to 40 human calculators.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FfVWqyIP4yQ8OdF4bnmVU%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=eccb2de0-645a-496c-84df-85298276ddb1" alt=""><figcaption><p>Bell Model III Relay Racks</p></figcaption></figure>

The Model V machine did not see military service. It was even more versatile and powerful, roughly ten times more capable than the Model III in terms of the number of calculators it could replace. Several computational modules, each containing 9,000 relays, could receive input from multiple stations where users entered various problem conditions. Each station had one tape reader for data input and five for instructions. This setup allowed for calling different subprograms during computations with the main tape. The main control module (essentially an early version of an operating system) distributed instructions to computational modules based on their availability, and programs could perform conditional branching. It was no longer just a calculator.

**The Year of Wonders: 1937**

The year 1937 can be considered a turning point in the history of computing machines. In that year, Shannon and Stibitz observed similarities between relay circuits and mathematical functions. These insights led Bell Labs to create a series of important digital machines. This was a kind of adaptation—or even substitution—where the humble telephone relay, without changing its physical form, became an embodiment of abstract mathematics and logic.

In the same year, the January issue of _Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society_ featured a paper by British mathematician Alan Turing titled “On Computable Numbers, With an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem.” In this paper, Turing described a universal computing machine, asserting that it could perform operations logically equivalent to those performed by human calculators. Turing, who had enrolled in Princeton University the previous year, was also intrigued by relay circuits. Like Bush, he was concerned about the escalating threat of war with Germany. Thus, he embarked on a side cryptographic project—a binary multiplier that could be used for encrypting military messages. Turing built it from relays sourced from the university's mechanical workshop.

In 1937, Howard Aiken, a Harvard graduate student in electrical engineering, contemplated a proposed automatic computing machine. Aiken, who had been doing a significant amount of calculations using only a mechanical calculator and printed mathematical tables, proposed a design that would eliminate this routine. Unlike existing computing devices, it was intended to automatically and cyclically process tasks, using the results of previous computations as input for the next.

Meanwhile, at Nippon Electric Company, telecommunications engineer Akira Nakashima had been exploring the connections between relay circuits and mathematics since 1935. By 1938, he independently proved the equivalence of relay circuits to Boolean algebra, which Shannon had discovered the year before.

In Berlin, Konrad Zuse, a former aviation engineer weary from endless calculations required by his job, sought funding to create a second computing machine. His first mechanical device, the V1, had failed to operate reliably, so he aimed to build a relay-based computer, which he developed in collaboration with his friend, telecommunications engineer Helmut Schreyer.

The versatility of telephone relays, the insights into mathematical logic, and the desire of brilliant minds to escape tedious work all converged to give rise to the concept of a new type of logical machine.

**The Forgotten Generation**

The fruits of the discoveries and developments of 1937 took several years to mature. The war proved to be the most potent fertilizer, and with its arrival, relay computers began appearing wherever the necessary technical expertise was available. Mathematical logic became the framework for electrical engineering. New forms of programmable computing machines emerged—the first drafts of modern computers.

In addition to Stibitz's machines, by 1944, the United States boasted the Harvard Mark I / IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator (ASCC), the result of Aiken's proposal. The dual name arose from deteriorating relations between the academic community and industry: everyone laid claim to the device. The Mark I / ASCC used control relay circuits, but its primary arithmetic module was built using IBM's mechanical calculator architecture. The machine was created for the U.S. Bureau of Shipbuilding. Its successor, the Mark II, began operations in 1948 at a Navy testing ground, and all its operations were based solely on relays—using 13,000 relays.

During the war, Zuse built several increasingly complex relay computers, culminating in the V4, which, like the Bell Model V, included subprogram calling facilities and conditional branching. Due to material shortages in Japan, none of Nakashima's and his compatriots' developments were realized in metal until the country recovered from the war. In the 1950s, the newly established Ministry of International Trade and Industry funded the creation of two relay machines, the second of which was a monster with 20,000 relays. Fujitsu, involved in its creation, developed its own commercial products.

Today, these machines are almost entirely forgotten. Only one name remains—ENIAC. The reason for this forgetfulness is not due to their complexity, capabilities, or speed. The computational and logical properties of relays discovered by scientists and researchers apply to any device that can act as a switch. It just so happened that another similar device—electronic switching—was available, which could operate hundreds of times faster than relays.

The importance of World War II in the history of computing machines should already be apparent. The most devastating war became a catalyst for the development of electronic machines. Its onset released the resources needed to overcome the obvious limitations of electronic switches. The dominance of electromechanical computers was short-lived. Like titans, they were overthrown by their successors. As with relays, electronic switching emerged out of the needs of the telecommunications industry. To understand its origins, we must rewind our history to the dawn of the radio era.

## The Electronic Era

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FlprUHkrugPH2uhYiWHyT%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=379c57cc-a071-47d5-8119-e93685bc2670" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Last time, we explored how the first generation of digital computers was built upon the first generation of automatic electrical switches – electromagnetic relays. By the time these computers were created, however, another class of digital switches was waiting in the wings: electronic switches. Unlike relays, which were electromagnetic devices (using electricity to control a mechanical switch), this new class of switches was electronic, based on new understandings of the electron that emerged in the early 20th century. This science revealed that the carrier of electrical force was not current, wave, or field, but rather a solid particle.

The device that ushered in the era of electronics based on this new physics was known as the "electron tube" (or "vacuum tube" in the U.S.). The history of its creation involves two key figures: the Englishman Ambrose Fleming and the American Lee de Forest. In reality, the origins of electronics are more complex, intertwining across Europe and the Atlantic, stretching back to early experiments with Leyden jars in the mid-18th century.

However, for the purposes of this discussion, it is convenient to focus on this history, beginning with Thomas Edison. In the 1880s, Edison made a notable discovery while working on electric lighting – a discovery that set the stage for our story. This development laid the groundwork for the further advancement of electronic lamps, which were required for two technological systems: a new form of wireless communication and the ever-expanding telephone networks.

**Prologue: Edison**

Edison is typically credited with inventing the electric light bulb. This accolade, however, does both too much and too little justice. It does too much because Edison was not the only inventor of the glowing lamp. In addition to the numerous predecessors whose creations did not reach commercial production, figures such as Joseph Swan and Charles Stearn from Britain, and American William Sawyer, also brought light bulbs to the market simultaneously with Edison. \[The honor of invention also belongs to Russian inventor Alexander Lodygin. Lodygin was the first to vacuum out the air from the glass bulb and suggested using tungsten for the filament instead of carbon or charred fibers / translator's note.] All lamps consisted of a sealed glass bulb with a resistive filament inside. When the lamp was connected to a circuit, the heat generated by the filament's resistance to current caused it to glow. The air was evacuated from the bulb to prevent the filament from burning out. Electric light was already known in major cities through arc lamps used to illuminate large public spaces. All these inventors sought to take a bright part of the burning arc, small enough to be used in homes to replace gas lamps, and make the light source safer, cleaner, and brighter.

What Edison actually accomplished – or rather, what his industrial laboratory achieved – was not merely creating a source of light. They built an entire electrical system for lighting homes – including generators, transmission wires, transformers, and so on. Of all these components, the light bulb was just the most visible and obvious part. Edison’s name in his electricity-producing companies was not merely a tribute to a great inventor, as was the case with Bell Telephone. Edison proved himself not only as an inventor but also as a system architect. His laboratory continued to work on improving various components of electrical lighting even after their initial success.

During his research around 1883, Edison (or perhaps one of his staff members) decided to include a metal plate inside the glowing lamp alongside the filament. The reasons for this action are unclear. It is possible that this was an attempt to mitigate the darkening of the lamp—the interior of the bulb would accumulate a mysterious dark substance over time. The engineer presumably hoped that these black particles would be attracted to the charged plate. To his surprise, he discovered that when the plate was connected to the circuit along with the positive end of the filament, the current flowing through the filament was directly proportional to the filament's brightness. No such effect was observed when the plate was connected to the negative end of the filament.

Edison concluded that this effect, later known as the Edison Effect or thermionic emission, could be used to measure or even control the "electromotive force," or voltage, in an electrical system. Habitually, he filed a patent for this "electrical indicator" and then returned to more pressing tasks.

**Wireless**

Fast forward 20 years to 1904. At that time, in England, John Ambrose Fleming was working for Marconi Company on improving radio wave receivers.

It's crucial to understand what radio was and wasn’t at that time, both as a tool and in practice. Radio was not yet referred to as “radio” but as “wireless.” The term “radio” did not become prevalent until the 1910s. Specifically, it referred to wireless telegraphy—a system for transmitting signals in the form of dots and dashes from sender to receiver. Its primary application was communication between ships and port authorities, and in this sense, it was of interest to maritime agencies worldwide.

Some inventors of the time, such as Reginald Fessenden, experimented with the concept of wireless telephony—transmitting voice messages through the air as a continuous wave. However, broadcasting in the modern sense—transmitting news, stories, music, and other programs for a wide audience—did not emerge until 15 years later. Until then, the all-encompassing nature of radio signals was seen as a problem to be solved rather than a feature to be utilized.

The radio equipment of the time was well-suited for Morse code but poorly adapted for everything else. Transmitters created Hertzian waves by sending a spark through a gap in the circuit, resulting in a signal accompanied by static crackle.

Receivers detected this signal using a coherer: metal filings in a glass tube that coalesced into a continuous mass under the influence of radio waves, thereby closing the circuit. The filings needed to be tapped to break them up and prepare the receiver for the next signal—initially done manually, but soon automatic devices were developed.

By 1905, crystal detectors, also known as "cat’s whisker" detectors, were just beginning to appear. It was found that simply touching a certain crystal, such as silicon, iron pyrite, or galena, with a wire could capture radio signals from the air. These detectors were inexpensive, compact, and accessible to everyone. They sparked the growth of amateur radio, especially among youth. The sudden influx of radio traffic led to problems due to the shared radio spectrum. Amateur enthusiasts' innocent conversations could accidentally interfere with maritime communications, and some mischief-makers even issued false orders and distress signals. Governments inevitably had to intervene. As Ambrose Fleming himself wrote, the advent of crystal detectors immediately led to a surge of irresponsible radio telegraphy due to the antics of countless amateur electricians and students, necessitating strict intervention by national and international authorities to keep things within reasonable and safe limits.

From the unusual electrical properties of these crystals would eventually emerge the third generation of digital switches, following relays and tubes—switches that dominate our world today. But that’s a story for another time. We’ve set the stage; now let’s turn our attention back to the actor who has just emerged under the spotlight: Ambrose Fleming, England, 1904.

**The Valve**

In 1904, Fleming was a professor of electrical engineering at University College London and a consultant for Marconi Company. Initially hired to provide expert evaluation for the construction of a power station, he soon turned his attention to improving the receiver.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2Ftrxif8CAttfmFSmLTHK3%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=c2555266-2bd2-42d2-baf2-5f85ac051032" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>Fleming in 1890</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

Everyone knew that the coherer was a poor receiver in terms of sensitivity, and the magnetic detector developed by Marconi was not much better. To find a replacement, Fleming initially decided to build a sensitive circuit for detecting Hertzian waves. Even if this device did not become a detector itself, it would be useful for future research.

To achieve this, he needed to devise a way to continuously measure the current generated by incoming waves, rather than using the discrete coherer (which only showed on-off states—where the filings either clumped together or did not). However, the known current measuring devices—galvanometers—required a steady, unidirectional current to operate. The alternating current induced by radio waves changed direction so rapidly that no measurement could be made.

Fleming recalled that he had some interesting devices gathering dust in his cabinet—Edison’s indicator lamps. In the 1880s, he had been a consultant for Edison Electric Light Company in London and worked on the problem of lamp blackening. At that time, he had received several indicator lamps, possibly from William Priest, the chief electrical engineer for the British Post Office, who had just returned from an electrical exhibition in Philadelphia. At that time, outside the U.S., postal services were accustomed to controlling telegraphs and telephones, making them centers of electrical expertise.

Later, in the 1890s, Fleming himself studied the Edison effect using the lamps he had received from Priest. He demonstrated that the effect involved current flowing in one direction only: negative electrical potential could flow from the hot filament to the cold electrode but not the other way around. However, it wasn’t until 1904, when faced with the task of detecting radio waves, that he realized this fact could be put to practical use. The Edison indicator would allow only unidirectional pulses of alternating current to bridge the gap between the filament and the plate, providing a steady and unidirectional flow.

Fleming took one lamp, connected it in series with a galvanometer, and activated a spark transmitter. Voilà—the mirror moved, and the light beam shifted on the scale. It worked. He was able to accurately measure incoming radio signals.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FlERL3o7VFgcEiyVKNUWq%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=647c0140-925b-49a0-bddf-350e190b48f5" alt=""><figcaption><p>Fleming’s Valve Prototypes. The Anode is Positioned in the Center of the Filament Loop (Hot Cathode)</p></figcaption></figure>

Fleming named his invention the "valve" because it allowed electricity to flow in only one direction. More generally, in electrical engineering terms, it was a rectifier—a method of converting alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). It was later referred to as a diode, due to its two electrodes: the hot cathode (filament) that emitted electricity and the cold anode (plate) that received it. Fleming made several improvements to the design, but fundamentally the device did not differ from Edison’s indicator lamp. Its transition to a new quality occurred through a change in conceptual thinking—something we have seen happen repeatedly. The change took place in Fleming’s mind rather than in the external world.

The valve itself was useful. It was the best field device for measuring radio signals and a decent detector on its own. However, it did not revolutionize the world. The explosive growth of electronics began only after Lee de Forest added a third electrode and transformed the valve into a triode.

**Background**

Lee de Forest had an unusual upbringing for a Yale student. His father, Reverend Henry de Forest, was a Civil War veteran from New York, a Congregationalist pastor who firmly believed that, as a preacher, he should spread the divine light of knowledge and justice. Answering the call of duty, he accepted an invitation to become president of Talladega College in Alabama. The college was founded after the Civil War by the American Missionary Association, based in New York, with the aim of educating and mentoring local African Americans. There, Lee felt caught between a rock and a hard place—local Black residents mocked him for his naivety and cowardice, while local whites derided him for being a Yankee.

Nevertheless, as a young man, de Forest developed a strong self-confidence. He discovered a knack for mechanics and inventions—his large-scale model locomotive became a local marvel. Even as a teenager, while studying at Talladega, he decided to dedicate his life to invention. Later, as a young man living in New Haven, he cast aside his last religious convictions. These beliefs gradually faded due to exposure to Darwinism and were swept away after his father's untimely death. Yet, de Forest’s sense of purpose remained—he considered himself a genius and aspired to be a second Nikola Tesla, a wealthy, famous, and enigmatic figure of the electrical age. His Yale classmates found him to be a self-satisfied windbag. He might be considered the least popular person encountered in our historical narrative.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FGkgx0dvLipv8MJGaVl1x%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=9c353b3c-3da2-40dc-ac2c-139fdec66c84" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>De Forest, circa 1900</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

After completing his studies at Yale University in 1899, de Forest chose to delve into the burgeoning art of wireless signal transmission as his path to wealth and fame. Over the subsequent decades, he pursued this path with great determination and confidence, without hesitation. His journey began with a collaboration between de Forest and his partner, Ed Smythe, in Chicago. Smythe kept their business afloat with regular payments, and together they developed their own radio wave detector, consisting of two metal plates joined by a paste de Forest referred to as "goo." However, de Forest was impatient for recognition of his genius. He parted ways with Smythe and teamed up with a dubious New York financier named Abraham White—who ironically changed his name from Schwartz to White to obscure his questionable dealings—founding the De Forest Wireless Telegraph Company.

The company's activities were secondary to both heroes. White exploited people's ignorance to line his pockets, extracting millions from investors eager not to miss the anticipated radio boom. Meanwhile, de Forest, benefiting from the influx of funds from these "suckers," focused on proving his genius through the development of a new American wireless transmission system, contrasting with the European systems developed by Marconi and others.

Unfortunately for the American system, de Forest's detector did not perform particularly well. For a time, he addressed this issue by adopting Reginald Fessenden's patented design for a detector called the "liquid barrette"—two platinum wires immersed in a sulfuric acid bath. Fessenden sued for patent infringement, and it seemed he would win the case. Unable to settle, de Forest persisted until he invented a new detector of his own. In the fall of 1906, he announced the creation of such a detector. At two separate meetings of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, de Forest described his new wireless detector, which he named the "Audion." However, its true origins are questionable.

For a time, de Forest's attempts to build a new detector revolved around passing current through a Bunsen burner flame, which he believed could act as an asymmetric conductor. This idea apparently did not succeed. At some point in 1905, he learned about Fleming's valve. De Forest convinced himself that this valve and his flame-based device were fundamentally the same—if the hot filament were replaced with a flame and enclosed in a glass bulb to contain the gas, it would yield the same valve. He developed a series of patents echoing the history of Fleming's valve inventions through gas flame-based detectors. It seems he sought to claim priority for the invention, circumventing Fleming's patent since work with Bunsen burners predated Fleming’s work (starting from 1900).

Whether this was self-deception or fraud is unclear, but the result was de Forest’s patent from August 1906 for a "vacuum glass vessel containing two separate electrodes, between which exists a gas medium that becomes conductive and forms a sensitive element when sufficiently heated." The equipment and operation of the device belonged to Fleming, while the explanation of its operation was de Forest’s. De Forest ultimately lost the patent dispute, although it took ten years.

An impatient reader might wonder why so much time is spent on this individual whose self-proclaimed genius lay in passing off others' ideas as his own. The reason lies in the transformations the Audion underwent during the last few months of 1906.

By that time, de Forest was out of work. White and his partners avoided responsibility for the Fessenden lawsuit by creating a new company, United Wireless, and transferring the assets of American De Forest for $1. De Forest was left with $1000 in severance pay and a few worthless patents, including the patent for the Audion. Accustomed to a lavish lifestyle, he faced severe financial difficulties and desperately tried to turn the Audion into a major success.

To understand what happened next, it’s important to know that de Forest believed he had invented a relay, in contrast to Fleming’s rectifier. He had constructed his Audion by connecting a battery to the cold plate of the valve and believed that a signal in the antenna circuit (connected to the hot filament) modulated a stronger current in the battery circuit. He was mistaken: these were not two separate circuits; the battery merely shifted the signal from the antenna, rather than amplifying it.

However, this mistake proved critical, leading de Forest to experiment with a third electrode in the bulb, which was supposed to further separate the two circuits of this "relay." Initially, he added a second cold electrode next to the first, but then, possibly influenced by the mechanisms used by physicists to redirect beams in electron tube devices, he moved the electrode to a position between the filament and the primary plate. He believed this arrangement could interrupt the flow of electricity and modified the shape of the third electrode from a plate to a wavy wire resembling a rasp—and called it the "grid."

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2Fu8BB3EMs1LBHwnWi23Rz%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=f26027fe-dbf6-437d-a0f1-0e858ca8a1e0" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>The Audion Triode of 1908</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

The 1908 Audion triode represented significant advancements over previous models. This device featured a hot cathode (represented by a broken filament) on the left, a wavy wire acting as the grid, and a rounded metal plate serving as the anode. Despite maintaining the screw base like a conventional light bulb, it was a fully functional relay.

The triode was indeed a relay because a weak current, applied to the grid, could control a much stronger current between the filament and the plate, affecting the charged particles attempting to pass between them. This detector performed far better than the Fleming valve, as it not only rectified but also amplified the radio signal. Unlike the coherer, which merely detected signals, the triode could produce a continuous signal, enabling the development of not only radio telegraphy but also radiotelephony, and eventually voice and music transmission.

However, in practice, the Audions had their issues. They were temperamental, prone to rapid failure, and suffered from inconsistent manufacturing quality. As amplifiers, they were inefficient and required precise adjustment of the circuit's electrical parameters to function correctly.

Despite these challenges, De Forest remained committed to his invention. He founded a new company, De Forest Radio Telephone Company, to promote the Audion. However, sales were modest. The most notable achievement was equipping the fleet for internal communication during the Great White Fleet's circumnavigation. Unfortunately, the fleet commander, lacking the time to set up and train the crew on De Forest's transmitters and receivers, ordered them to be packed away. Furthermore, De Forest's new company, managed by a successor of Abraham White, proved to be just as unscrupulous, and De Forest soon faced accusations of fraud.

Over five years, the Audion failed to make significant strides. The telephone would once again play a crucial role in advancing digital relays, rescuing a promising but overlooked technology from obscurity.

**And Again, the Telephone**

Long-distance communication was the central nervous system of AT\&T, uniting numerous local companies and providing a key competitive advantage following the expiration of Bell's patents. In theory, by joining the AT\&T network, a new subscriber could connect with all other subscribers thousands of kilometers away—though long-distance calls were rarely made. This network was the material foundation for the company's ideology of "One Policy, One System, Universal Service."

By the beginning of the second decade of the 20th century, however, the network had reached its physical limits. The farther telephone wires stretched, the weaker and noisier the signal became, making speech almost unintelligible. Consequently, there were effectively two AT\&T networks in the U.S., divided by the continental divide.

For the eastern network, New York was the anchor, with mechanical repeaters and Pupin coils determining how far the human voice could travel. But these technologies were not all-powerful. Coils reduced voice frequency attenuation but did not eliminate it. Mechanical repeaters, simply telephone speakers connected to amplifying microphones, added noise with each repetition. By 1911, the line from New York to Denver had reached its maximum length. Expanding the network across the continent seemed impossible. However, in 1909, John Carthy, AT\&T's chief engineer, publicly promised to achieve this within five years, by the start of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915.

The first to make this possible with a new telephone amplifier was not an American, but a scion of a wealthy Viennese family interested in science. As a young man, Robert von Lieben, with the financial support of his parents, acquired a telephone manufacturing company and set out to create an amplifier for telephone conversations. By 1906, he had developed a relay based on electron beam tubes, which were widely used in physical experiments and later became the foundation for video screens in the 20th century. A weak incoming signal controlled an electromagnet that deflected the beam, modulating a stronger current in the main circuit.

By 1910, von Lieben and his colleagues, Eugene Rae and Sigmund Strauss, learned about De Forest's Audion and replaced the magnet in the tube with a grid that controlled the cathode rays. This design proved to be the most effective and surpassed all previous developments in the U.S. The German telephone network soon adopted von Lieben's amplifier. In 1914, this amplifier enabled a critical telephone call from the commander of the East Prussian army to the German headquarters in Koblenz, 1000 kilometers away. This event influenced strategic decisions, sending Generals Hindenburg and Ludendorff eastward. Subsequently, these amplifiers were used to connect the German headquarters with field armies in the south and east, including Macedonia and Romania.

**Copy of the Improved Cathode Ray Relay by von Lieben**

The improved cathode ray relay designed by von Lieben featured a cathode at the bottom, an anode in the form of a coil at the top, and a grid consisting of a round metal foil in the middle.

However, language and geographic barriers, as well as the war, prevented this design from reaching the United States, and soon other developments overtook it.

Meanwhile, De Forest left the struggling Radio Telephone Company in 1911 and fled to California. There, he joined the Federal Telegraph Company in Palo Alto, founded by Stanford graduate Cyril Elwell. Nominally, De Forest was supposed to work on an amplifier to increase the output volume of the federal radio receiver. In reality, he, Herbert Van Etten (an experienced telephone engineer), and Charles Logwood (a receiver developer) were focused on creating a telephone amplifier to compete for a rumored $1 million prize from AT\&T.

To this end, De Forest retrieved an Audion from storage, and by 1912, he and his colleagues had developed a device ready for demonstration at the telephone company. It consisted of several Audions connected in series to provide multi-stage amplification, along with several auxiliary components. The device worked in principle—it could amplify a signal enough to hear a falling handkerchief or ticking pocket watch. However, it only functioned at currents and voltages too low to be useful for telephony. Increasing the current caused the Audions to emit a blue glow, and the signal turned into noise. Nonetheless, the telephone engineers were intrigued enough to pass the device to their engineers to see what improvements could be made. One of them, young physicist Harold Arnold, knew precisely how to correct the Federal Telegraph amplifier.

It was time to discuss how the valve and the Audion worked. The key understanding required to explain their operation emerged from the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, the intellectual center of new electronic physics. In 1899, J.J. Thomson demonstrated through experiments with cathode ray tubes that a particle with mass, later known as the electron, carried current from the cathode to the anode. In the following years, Owen Richardson, Thomson’s colleague, developed this concept into a mathematical theory of thermionic emission.

Ambrose Fleming, an engineer working a short train ride from Cambridge, was familiar with this research. He understood that his valve operated due to thermionic emission of electrons from the heated filament across the vacuum gap to the cold anode. However, the vacuum in the indicator lamp was not very deep—sufficient for a regular light bulb. It was adequate to remove enough oxygen to prevent the filament from burning out. Fleming realized that for the valve to work optimally, the vacuum needed to be as complete as possible to prevent residual gas from interfering with the electron flow.

De Forest did not grasp this. Coming to the valve and Audion through experiments with a Bunsen burner, he believed that a hot, ionized gas was the working medium of the device and that its complete removal would stop the device from functioning. This misconception led to the Audion’s instability and dissatisfaction as a radio receiver, and it emitted a blue light.

Arnold at AT\&T was in an ideal position to correct De Forest’s mistake. He was a physicist who had studied under Robert Millikan at the University of Chicago and was hired specifically to apply his knowledge of new electronic physics to the task of building a coast-to-coast telephone network. He knew that the Audion would perform best in an almost perfect vacuum, understood that new pumps could achieve such a vacuum, and realized that a new type of oxide-coated filament, along with a larger plate and grid, would also enhance the electron flow. In short, he transformed the Audion into an electronic tube, a marvel of the electronic age.

AT\&T acquired a powerful amplifier necessary for building the transcontinental line but lacked the rights to use it. Company representatives were skeptical during negotiations with De Forest but eventually engaged a third-party attorney who managed to acquire the rights to use the Audion as a telephone amplifier for $50,000 (approximately $1.25 million in 2017 dollars). The New York–San Francisco line opened just in time, more as a triumph of technical virtuosity and corporate advertising than as a practical means of communication. The cost of calls was so astronomical that few could afford to use it.

**The Electronic Era**

The true electronic tube became the root of a whole new tree of electronic components. Like relays, the electronic tube continually expanded its applications as engineers found new ways to adapt its design for specific tasks. The growth of "-ode" types did not end with diodes and triodes. It continued with tetrodes, which added an additional grid to support amplification as circuit elements grew. Subsequently, pentodes, heptodes, and even octodes appeared. There were also thyratrons filled with mercury vapor, glowing with a sinister blue light. Miniature tubes the size of a little finger or even an acorn. Tubes with indirectly heated cathodes, where the hum of the AC source did not interfere with the signal. The book _Saga of the Vacuum Tube_, describing the growth of the tube industry up to 1930, lists over 1000 different models by their index—though many were counterfeit copies from unreliable brands like Altron, Perfectron, Supertron, Volttron, and so on.

<figure><img src="https://4146235939-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVsJVX5kOfAZOe1840NhZ%2Fuploads%2FOs8cMd7ZaywvHDHbzBqb%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=8517d9f6-6d20-4c9c-8d98-3b208495f767" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**The Versatility of Electronic Tubes**

The diversity of applications for the electronic tube was even more significant than its various forms. Regenerative circuits turned the triode into a transmitter—capable of producing smooth and consistent sinusoidal waves without noisy sparks, perfect for transmitting sound. With a coherer and sparks, Marconi in 1901 could barely transmit a short Morse code snippet across a narrow part of the Atlantic. By 1915, using an electronic tube as both transmitter and receiver, AT\&T could transmit the human voice from Arlington, Virginia, to Honolulu—twice that distance. By the 1920s, they combined long-distance telephony with high-quality sound broadcasting to create the first radio networks. Thus, soon the entire nation could listen to the same voice on the radio, whether it was Roosevelt or Hitler.

Moreover, the ability to create transmitters tuned to precise and stable frequencies enabled telecommunications engineers to realize a long-held dream of frequency multiplexing that had intrigued Alexander Bell, Edison, and others forty years earlier. By 1923, AT\&T had a ten-channel voice line from New York to Pittsburgh. The ability to transmit multiple voices over a single copper wire radically reduced the cost of long-distance calls, which had previously been affordable only to the wealthiest individuals and businesses due to their high cost. Seeing the potential of electronic tubes, AT\&T sent their lawyers to acquire additional rights from De Forest, securing the rights to use the Audion in all available applications. They paid him a total of $390,000, equivalent to about $7.5 million today.

Why, then, did electronic tubes not dominate the first generation of computers as they did in radio and other telecommunications equipment? It was clear that a triode could serve as a digital switch just as well as a relay. So obvious was this that De Forest even believed he had created a relay before he actually did. And the triode was much more responsive than traditional electromechanical relays, as it did not require physically moving an armature. A typical relay required several milliseconds to switch, whereas the change in current from cathode to anode due to a change in the grid's electric potential was nearly instantaneous.

However, tubes had a clear disadvantage compared to relays: their tendency to burn out, much like their predecessors, the light bulbs. The lifespan of De Forest's original Audion was so short—about 100 hours—that it contained a spare filament to be connected after the first burned out. This was a significant issue, and even the best-quality tubes could only be expected to last a few thousand hours. For computers with thousands of tubes and long computing times, this was a serious problem.

In contrast, relays, according to George Stibitz, were "fantastically reliable." So much so that he claimed: If a set of U-shaped relays had started operating in the year 1 AD and switched contacts once per second, they would still be working today. The first contact failure could be expected no earlier than a thousand years from then, around the year 3000.

Moreover, there was no experience with large electronic circuits comparable to the electromechanical circuits used by telephone engineers. Radio receivers and other equipment might contain 5-10 tubes, but not hundreds of thousands. No one knew if a computer with 5,000 tubes could be made to work. By choosing relays over tubes, computer developers made a safe and conservative choice.

In the next section, we will see how and why these doubts were eventually overcome.
