I'm [Abdulrahman Tamim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdulrahman-tamim-a7149a29b/), a Cybersecurity Engineering sophomore at Abu Dhabi University with a long-standing passion for cybersecurity that started back in high school.

Iâ€™m currently focused on **Red Teaming** and **DevSecOps**, gaining hands-on experience with **penetration testing**, **vulnerability assessments**, and **infrastructure hardening**â€”across networks, cloud environments, and Active Directory setups.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into **low-level security concepts** like binary exploitation, memory management, and reverse engineering. Iâ€™m fascinated by how systems behave under pressure and how seemingly small flaws can lead to big breaches. Iâ€™m also sharpening my skills in programming (mostly Python and C, with some Rust exploration), and building tools to support my workflow.

I try to stay up to date with **modern exploitation techniques**, and I enjoy breaking things in controlled environmentsâ€”CTFs, labs, home labsâ€”anything that challenges how well I understand a system.

Beyond tech, I like exploring **math**, **philosophy**, and **politics**â€”fields that push critical thinking and broaden perspective.

> _Always learning, always buildingâ€”one layer deeper every day._
